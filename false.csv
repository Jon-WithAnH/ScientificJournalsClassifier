Acupuncture, an important method in Traditional Chinese Medicine, is widely used in clinical practice as a treatment for migraine. Several systematic reviews (SRs) have investigated the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for migraine. Objective To summarize and critically assess the quality of relevant SRs and present an objective and comprehensive evidence on the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for migraine. Data Sources. MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, PROSPERO database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Biological Medicine (CBM), China Science and Technology Journal (SCTJ), and WanFang database (WF) were searched from inception to December 2019 and grey literatures were manually searched. Selection Criteria. SRs which meet the criteria were independently selected by 2 reviewers according to a predetermined protocol. Data Extraction. Characteristics of included SRs were independently extracted by 2 reviewers following a predefined data extraction form. Review Appraisal. The methodological quality, risk of bias, and reporting quality of included SRs were assessed, respectively, by a Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2, the Risk of Bias in Systematic reviews (ROBIS) tool, and the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis-Acupuncture (PRISMA-A) statement. The quality of outcomes was evaluated by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). Results A total of 15 SRs were included. All the SRs were published between 2011–2019. Based on AMSTAR 2, 14 out of 15 SRs were rated critically low quality and 1 was rated low quality. According to ROBIS tool, 9 SRs (60%) were low risk of bias. With the PRISMA-A checklist, we found 11 out of 15 SRs were found adequately reported over 70%. With the GRADE tool, we found high quality of evidence indicated that the effective rate of acupuncture was superior to western medicine in treatment of migraine. Besides, acupuncture reduced more headache days and the times of using painkiller and was more effective in reducing the frequency and degree of headache than western medicine and sham acupuncture. Limitations. There might be some missing information. The accuracy of the conclusions may be decreased reduced since we were unable to synthesis all the evidence. Conclusions Based on high quality of evidence, we concluded that acupuncture may be an effective and safe therapy for migraine. However, the quality of SRs in acupuncture for migraine still needs more improvement. 1. IntroductionMigraine is a common neurological disease characterized by unilateral, throbbing recurrent headache, often accompanied by photophobia, phonophobia, or nausea [1]. According to the epidemiological statistics, the prevalence of migraine is 3.3%∼32.6% in female and 0.7%∼16.1% in male [2]. At the same time, it costs between 6.5 and 17 billion dollars annually in the USA which severely burdened individuals and society [3, 4]. In the Global Burden of Disease Survey 2010, migraine ranked as the 3rd most prevalent disorder and 7th highest specific cause of disability worldwide [5, 6]. The standard treatments for migraine include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antiepileptic drugs, ergotamines, and triptans. However, these pharmacotherapies were often accompanied with undesirable adverse effects [7], such as fatigue, sleep disturbance, nausea, and vomiting [8] which lead to poor compliance of patients. Therefore, more and more patients are seeking for effective nonpharmacological alternative treatments.Acupuncture, an important method in Traditional Chinese Medicine, is widely used in clinical practice as a treatment for migraine. It is reported that acupuncture was one of the most common complementary therapies in worldwide [9]. In German-speaking countries, acupuncture has high utilization and is one of the most primarily used methods to relieve pain [10]. Now, it is increasingly accepted in western countries as an alternative treatment for migraine and other pain conditions [11]. The results of clinical studies have demonstrated that acupuncture is an effective and safe therapeutic approach to treat migraine [12–14]. With the development of evidence-based medicine, numerous systematic reviews (SRs) have been conducted to investigate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for migraine. However, the results of these SRs often have limitations which may lower the quality of conclusions and mislead the patients, clinical doctors, and policy makers.Overviews of SRs, a method to evaluate the quality of evidence [15], is becoming more and more prevalent in evidence-based medicine [16]. The overview is a comprehensive approach to reassess the quality of SRs by collecting the information of relevant SRs dealing with the same disease or health problem [17]. While SR has always been regarded as one of the most important sources of high quality and reliable information in the evidence-based medicine [18], there are many factors in the evaluation process which can decrease the quality of SRs, such as incomprehensive source of literature, inadequate evaluation method, and publication bias. Overview of SRs comprehensively integrated the evidence of SRs, which contains more information and can provide more high-quality evidence for clinical work.This is the first overview which comprehensively assessed SRs of acupuncture for migraine with a Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2, the Risk of Bias in Systematic reviews (ROBIS), Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis-Acupuncture (PRISMA-A), and the Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). The objective of this overview is to critically assess the quality of relevant SRs and present an objective and comprehensive evaluation on effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for migraine, which can help the public and policy-makers understand whether acupuncture should be recommended as a treatment for migraine. 2. Methods2.1. RegistrationA predetermined written protocol of this overview was registered in the PROSPERO (International prospective register of systematic overview) database (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/), registration number: CRD42017077218. This overview was reported in accordance with the guideline of the pilot version checklist with Preferred Reporting Items for overview of systematic reviews (PRIO-harms) [19].2.2. EthicsEthics approval is not required in overview of SRs, since it does not involve individual patient data.2.3. Inclusion Criteria2.3.1. Types of Reviews SRs with or without meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in which acupuncture was used as treatment for migraine.2.3.2. Types of Participants SRs included RCT recruiting participants diagnosed with migraine according to standard diagnostic criteria (e.g., the International Classification of Headache Disorders released by the International Headache Society or other domestic standards). There was no restriction on the gender, age, race, duration, intensity, condition, and source of the patients.2.3.3. Types of Interventions There was no restriction on the types of acupuncture (e.g., body acupuncture, electroacupuncture, auricular acupuncture, warm-acupuncture, and scalp acupuncture).2.3.4. Types of Comparators SRs included control groups which were treated with sham-acupuncture, placebo, medicine, and other types of nonpharmaceutical therapy or placed in the waiting list.2.3.5. Types of Outcomes The primary outcome was effective rate. Secondary outcomes included intensity, frequency or duration of headache, times of using painkiller, quality of life, recurrent rate, and adverse effects of acupuncture in migraine.2.4. Exclusion CriteriaThe SRs were excluded if one of the following criteria was met: did not use the diagnostic criteria of migraine mentioned above; SRs with network meta-analysis or indirect comparison; SRs that included retrospective studies, prospective studies, cross-sectional clinical studies, and case reports; SRs whose data could not be extracted; duplicated publication; review comments.2.5. Search StrategyAn electronic literature search was conducted in the MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, PROSPERO database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Biological Medicine (CBM) database, Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (SCTJ), and WanFang database, all from the inception to December 2019. Details of search strategy were presented in Supplementary . In addition, reference lists/bibliographies of included studies, study registries, and grey literature, such as dissertations and conference reports, were also searched to avoid missing studies. Besides, the experts in the field were also consulted. No language restrictions were applied.2.6. ScreeningThe reviewer (JZ) searched the databases according to the predeveloped standardized search strategy. All the retrieved literatures were imported into Endnote X8. Two reviewers (HY and YXL) independently screened for candidates according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria by reading the title and abstract. Then, the full texts were downloaded for further screening. At the same time, bibliographic references were also reviewed to identify possible SRs. The disagreements were resolved by discussion. If necessary, the discrepancies were resolved by consulting the third reviewer (DLZ).2.7. Data ExtractionA data extracted form was predefined, including the characteristics of SRs, such as author, title, published year, sample size, intervention, outcome indicators, quality evaluation method, and conclusion. Data was independently extracted by two reviewers (HY and LJL) using Microsoft Excel. After extraction, the two reviewers (LHS and YXL) cross checked to eliminate mis-entry. Discrepancies were resolved by team discussion or arbitrated by the third reviewer (DLZ).2.8. Assessment of SRsThe assessment of included SRs was carried out independently by qualified reviewers who were trained in the Chinese Cochrane Center. Before the evaluation, each topic of the assessment tools was intensively discussed to achieve consensus. After evaluation, two reviewers cross checked the results. Discrepancies were resolved by team discussion or an independent decision form a third reviewer.AMSTAR 2 [20] was used to assess the methodological quality of included SRs. The checklist has 16 items, including 7 critical items (items 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15), which are used to critically assess the validity of an SR. Each item was evaluated as “yes” (a positive result), “partial yes” (partial adherence to the standard), and “no” (no information is provided to rate an item) according to adherence to the standard.The aim of the ROBIS tool is to evaluate the level of bias presented in a systematic review. This tool assesses the level of bias across 4 domains of 2 phases: “study eligibility criteria,” “identification and selection of studies,” “data collection and study appraisal,” and “synthesis and findings”. Each domain has signaling questions and a judgment of concerns about risk of bias of the domain, and the results are rated as “high risk,” “low risk,” or “unclear risk” [21].PRISMA-A statements an extension of PRISMA especially for acupuncture, which was published in 2019 [22]. It consists of a 27-item checklist and a 4-phase flow diagram, aiming to help authors improve the reporting quality of SRs on acupuncture interventions. Seven aspects of SRs include title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion and funding. Response options for each item are “yes,” “no,” and “not applicable”. The completion of each item was presented as a ratio.The quality of primary outcomes of included SRs was evaluated by the GRADE system [23]. The assessment of included SRs was carried out independently by qualified reviewers (JL and DLZ) who were trained in the GRADE Center in China (Lanzhou). The 5 key elements of GRADE influenced the quality of evidence including study limitations, inconsistency of results, indirectness of evidence, imprecision, and reporting bias. The quality of evidences of SRs was rated as “High,” “Moderate,” “Low,” and “Very Low”. Evidence based on RCTs began as high quality. 3. Results3.1. Literature SearchWe retrieved 457 records according to the search strategy. 11 duplicates were excluded by filtration, 445 papers were screened by titles and abstracts. 65 articles were considered eligible, and full-text papers were downloaded. After being reviewed by two reviewers independently, 50 SRs were excluded and 15 SRs [24–38] were included for further analyses (Figure 1). The reasons for exclusion are presented in Supplementary .Open in a separate windowFigure 1Flowchart of the selection process of included SRs.3.2. Characteristics of SRsThe characteristics of included SRs are presented in Table 1. All the included SRs were published between 2011–2019, 6 of which were published in 2016 [21, 31–34, 36]. The number of RCTs in SRs ranged from 2 to 33. 3 SRs were on prophylactic treatment for migraine [31, 33, 35], 1 SR on acute migraine [33], 1 SR for menstrual migraine [36], 1 SR for migraine without aura [37], and the others did not clearly stated the type of migraine. 11 SRs specified the diagnostic criteria of HIS (International Headache Society) or ICHD (International Classification of Headache Disorders), while 4 SRs [25, 27, 28, 32] did not report the diagnostic criteria. All the 15 SRs performed meta-analysis, 10 out of 15 SRs [24–29, 31, 32, 35, 38] performed subgroup analysis, and only 4 SRs [30, 33, 34, 36, 38] conducted sensitivity analysis. The intervention was acupuncture, while comparators were mainly sham acupuncture and medications (ergotamine, ibuprofen, flunarizine, nimodipine, celecoxib, aspirin, somedon, sodium valproate, metoprolol, and topiramate). The outcomes of SRs were effective rate, intensity, and frequency or duration of headache. For the assessment of methodological quality, 2 SRs [24, 29] used the Jadad scale, 12 SRs [25, 26, 30–34, 36, 38] used the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and the remaining 1 SR [27] did not report any specific tool but described 6 aspects of quality assessment, including randomization, allocation concealment, blind method, data integrity, selective reporting, and other biases.Table 1Characteristics of included SRs.First author and year of publicationIncluded study designNo. of studyNo. of patientDiagnostic criteriaInterventionComparatorOutcomesAssessment of methodological qualityMeta-analysis conducted?Subgroup analysis conducted?Sensitivity analysis conducted?SafetyGao (2011)RCT121744IHS; ICHD-10AcupunctureSham acupunctureEffective rate; headache daysJadad scaleYesYesNoNRZheng (2012)RCT333593NRAcupunctureHerbs; sham acupunctureEffective rateCochrane risk of bias toolYesYesNoNRChen (2014)RCT181672IHSAcupunctureMedications (flunarizine, ibuprofen, nimodipine, naproxen, ergotamine caffeine); herbsEffective rate; headache frequency; headache intensity and duration; accompanying symptomsCochrane risk of bias toolYesYesYesYesYang (2014)RCT10893NRAcupunctureFlunarizineShort-term effect; long-term effect; headache scoreNRYesNoNoYesZhao (2014)RCT171719NREAMedicationsEffective rate; VASCochrane risk of bias toolYesYesNoYesDai (2015)RCT2140IHSAcupunctureMedications (flunarizine, nimodipine)Cure rate; effective rateJadad scaleYesNoNoNRYang (2015)RCT10997IHSAcupunctureSham acupunctureEffective rate; headache intensity; headache frequency; headache duration; medication use; accompanying symptomsCochrane risk of bias toolYesYesNoYesLinde (2016)RCT224985IHSAcupunctureSham interventions; medications (metoprolol, flunarizine, valproic acid); waiting listHeadache frequency; the proportion of “responders”Cochrane risk of bias toolYesYesNoNRPu J (2016)RCT5618NRAcupunctureSham acupunctureVASCochrane risk of bias toolYesNoNoNoPu (2016)RCT71285IHSAcupunctureMedications (flunarizine, valproate, topiramate, metoprolol)Effective rate; headache frequency; headache intensity; medication useCochrane risk of bias toolYesNoYesYesSong (2016)RCT181470IHS; ICHDAcupuncture; EAMedications (flunarizine, ibuprofen, nimodipine, metoprolol); placeboLong-term effective rate; short-term effective rate; headache daysCochrane risk of bias toolYesYesYesYesXian (2016)RCT263657IHS; ICHDAcupunctureSham acupuncture; medications (flunarizine, sodium valproate, metoprolol, topiramate, nimodipine)Effective rate; headache frequency; VAS; medication use; PDI; MIDAS; PF-SF36; MH-SF36Cochrane risk of bias tool YesNoYesZhao (2016)RCT181268IHSAcupuncture; auricular acupuncture; EAMedications (celecoxib, flunarizine, aspirin, ibuprofen, somedon); herbsEffective rate; VAS; headache intensity; headache frequencyCochrane risk of bias tool YesYesYesXu (2018)RCT141155ICHDAcupuncture; EAMedications (ergotamine, ibuprofen, flunarizine, nimodipine); sham acupunctureFrequency of migraine attacks; number of migraine days; VAS; effective rateCochrane risk of bias toolYesNoNoYesLu (2019)RCT172226ICHD-3Acupuncture; EASham acupuncture; medications (ergotamine, flunarizine, nimodipine)Frequency of migraine attacks; duration of migraine; headache intensityCochrane risk of bias toolYesYesYesNROpen in a separate windowIHS = International Headache Society; ICHD = International Classification of Headache Disorders; NR = no report; AA = auricular acupuncture; EA = electro-acupuncture; acupuncture = classical manual acupuncture; VAS = Visual Analogue Scale/Score; PDI = Pain Disability Index; MIDAS = the Migraine Disability Assessment; SF-36/12 = Short Form 36/12 Questionnaire.3.3. Methodological Quality of Included SRsAn overview of methodological quality of included SRs is presented in Table 2. Among the 15 SRs, 14 were rated critically low quality and 1 was rated low quality [37]. Items 2, 3, 7, 10, and 16 were rated particularly low quality. All SRs used satisfactory techniques to assess the risk of bias. Only 1 SR [37] established a prior study protocol and 2 [28, 36] reported the funding sources of the included studies. No SR explained the reasons for selection of study types or provided a complete list of excluded studies with reasons. And, few SRs assessed publication bias by a funnel plot.Table 2Methodological quality of included SRs on acupuncture for migraine.Author (year)I1I2∗I3I4∗I5I6I7∗I8I9∗I10I11∗I12I13∗I14I15∗I16Ranking of qualityGao (2011)YNNPYNNNYYNNYYNYNCritically lowZheng (2012)YNNPYYYNNYNNYYNNNCritically lowChen (2014)YNNPYYYNPYYNYYYNYNCritically lowYang (2014)YNNPYYNNPYYNNNNNNNCritically lowZhao (2014)YNNPYYYNPYYYYNNNNNCritically lowDai (2015)NNNPYNNNNYNNNNYNNCritically lowYang (2015)YNNPYNYNPYYNYYYYNNCritically lowLinde (2016)YNNPYYYNPYYNYYYNNNCritically lowPuJ (2016)YNNPYYYNNYNYNNYNNCritically lowPu (2016)YNNPYYYNYYNYYNYNNCritically lowSong (2016)YNNNYYNPYYNYYNYYNCritically lowXian (2016)YNNPYYYNYYNYNNYNNCritically lowZhao (2016)YNNPYYYNYYYYYYNYNCritically lowXu (2018)YYNPYYYNYYNYNYYYYLowLu (2019)YNNPYYYNYYNYNYYYNCritically lowOpen in a separate window ∗The key items of the AMSTAR 2; I: item; Y: yes; N: no; PY: partial yes.

Risk of Bias of Included SRsThe ROBIS tool, containing 3 phases with 4 domains, was used to assess the risk of bias of included SRs. Phase 1 assesses the relevance of research question, which is optional and was not performed in our study.  Table 3 and Figure 2 present the assessment of risk of bias of each SR. Domain 1 assessed concerns regarding specification of study eligibility criteria, and 12 of 15 SRs (80%) were rated low risk of bias. Domain 2 assessed concerns regarding methods used to identify and select studies, in which 9 SRs (60%) were in low risk of bias. Domain 3 assessed concerns regarding methods used to collect data and appraise studies, and 11 SRs (73%) were at low risk of bias and 1 [24] unclear risk of bias. Domain 4 assessed concerns regarding the synthesis and findings, and 8 SRs (53%) were rated as low risk of bias. The final phase considered the overall risk of bias of SRs, and 9 SRs (60%) were low risk of bias.Open in a separate windowFigure 2Graphical presentation of risk of bias of included SRs.Table 3Tabular presentation of risk of bias of included SRs.ReviewPhase 2Phase 31.

Reporting Quality of Included SRs Table 4 presents the overview of PRISMA-A checklist items. 11 out of 15 SRs were adequately reported over 70%. The section of title, abstract, and introduction were all well reported (100%). Though in Section 2, topic of protocol and registration, search strategy, study selection, data items, risk of bias, and additional analyses were reported inadequately, three topics (study selection, risk of bias across studies, and additional analysis) in Section 3 were reported under 70%. Of all the items, protocol and registration (13.33%), search strategy (33.33%), risk of bias in individual studies (33.33%), and risk of bias across studies (33.33%) accounted for the main reporting limitations. Overall, 4 SRs [26, 36–38] reached over 85% compliance.Table 4Compliance of included SRs with PRISMA-A checklist. Section/topicGao (2011)Zheng (2012)Chen (2014)Yang (2014)Zhao (2014)Dai (2015)Yang (2015)Linde (2016)PuJ (2016)Pu (2016)Song (2016)Xian (2016)Zhao (2016)Xu (2018)Lu (2019)Compliance (%)1TitleTitleYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY100.002AbstractStructured summaryYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY100.003IntroductionRationaleYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY100.004 ObjectivesYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY100.005MethodsProtocol and registrationNNNNNNNYNNNNNYN13.336 Eligibility criteriaYNYYYNYYYYYYYYY86.677 Information sourcesYYYNYYYNNYYYYYY80.008 SearchNNYNNNYYNNNNYNY33.339 Study selectionYNYYNNNYNYNYNYY53.3310 Data collection processNYYYYNYYYYYNYYY80.0011 Data itemsNNYYNNYYNYNYYYY6012 Risk of bias in individual studiesYYYYYNYYYYYYYYY93.3313 Summary measuresYYYYNYYYYYYYYYY93.3314 Synthesis of resultsYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY100.0015 Risk of bias across studiesYNYNNNNNNNYNYYN33.3316 Additional analysesYYYNNNYYNYYYYYY73.3317ResultsStudy selectionYNYYNNNYNYYNYNN53.3318 Study characteristicsYNYYYNYYYYYYYYY86.6719 Risk of bias within studiesYYYYYNYYYYYYYYY93.3320 Results of individual studiesYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY100.0021 Synthesis of resultsYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY100.0022 Risk of bias across studiesYNYNNNNNNNYNYYN33.3323 Additional analysisYNYNNNYYNYNNYNY46.6724DiscussionSummary of evidenceYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY100.0025 LimitationsNYYYYNYYNYYYYYY86.6726ConclusionsYYYYYNYYYYYYYYY93.3327FundingFundingNNNYNNNYYNYNYYY46.67   77.78%59.26%92.59%74.07%59.26%37.03%77.78%88.89%59.26%81.48%81.48%70.37%92.59%88.89%88.89% Open in a separate window3.6. Effectiveness of Acupuncture for MigraineWe summarized the outcomes from the included SRs and presented them in Table 5. The evidence suggested that the effective rate of acupuncture was superior to western medicine (risk ratio (RR) = 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) = (1.12, 1.22), P = 0.71) [26]. Acupuncture had better long-term effective rate for migraine (RR = 4.17, 95% CI (2.80, 6. 20), P < 0.00001) [34, 35] and reduced more headache days (standardized mean difference (SMD) = −0.13, 95% CI = (−0.25, −0.02), P = 0.02) and the times of using painkiller (SMD = −0.73, 95% CI = (−2.14, 0.69), P = 0.31) than western medicine and sham acupuncture, both in short-term and long-term follow-up [33, 35]. Besides, acupuncture was more effective in reducing frequency (SMD = −2.18, 95% CI = (−2.61, −1.75), P < 0.00001) and degree of headache (SMD = −1.93, 95% CI = (−2.53, −1.36), P = 0.005) than western medicine and sham acupuncture [31, 35]. One SR [25] reported more effective rate of acupuncture than Chinese herbal medicine in treating migraine (RR = 1.29, 95% CI = (1.14, 1.45), P < 0.00001).Table 5Summary of evidence.Author (year)Outcomes (total patient number in the intervention group/total patient number in the control group or total participants in both groups, number of studies)Acupuncture vs sham-acupunctureGao (2011)Effective rate (OR = 1.28, 95% C (1.02, 1.61), P=0.03) (650/603, 8)Zheng (2012)Effective rate (RR = 1.87, 95% CI (1.17, 2.98), P=0.009) (91/54, 3)Chen (2014)Effective rate (RR = 1.19, 95% CI (1.13, 1.25), P=0.06), (596/438, 13);

Evidence Quality of Included SRsWe evaluated the quality of primary outcomes extracted from included studies.  Table 6 shows the level of evidence quality of studies reported effective rate. The high level of evidence quality indicated that the effective rate of acupuncture was superior than western medicine, both in short-term and long-term. The inconsistency and imprecision were the main reasons for downgrading. Significant heterogeneity downgraded inconsistency and imprecision was downgraded because the total sample size did not meet the optimal information size.Table 6Evidence quality of included studies.Author (date)Interventions vs comparisonsOutcomes (number of studies)Risk of biasInconsistencyIndirectionImprecisionPublication biasQuality of evidenceGao (2011)Acupuncture vs sham acupunctureEffective rate at the end of treatment (8)000−1①0ModerateEffective rate at the end of follow-up (4)0−1②0−1①0LowZheng (2012)Acupuncture vs western medicineEffective rate (8)0−1②000LowAcupuncture vs Chinese medicine therapyEffective rate (3)000−1①−1③LowAcupuncture vs sham acupunctureEffective rate (3)000−1①−1③LowChen (2014)Acupuncture vs western medicineEffective rate (13)00000HighYang (2014)Acupuncture vs western medicineShort-term effective rate (9)0−1②000LowLong-term effective rate (4)0−1②0—1①0Very lowZhao (2014)Acupuncture vs Western medicineEffective rate (11)00000HighDai (2014)Acupuncture vs western medicineEffective rate (2)0−1②0−1①−1③Very lowPu (2016)Acupuncture vs western medicineEffective rate after 3–4 months follow-up (4)0−1②0−1①−1③Very lowEffective rate after 5–6 months follow-up (2)000−1①−1③LowSong (2016)Acupuncture vs western medicineShort-term effective rate (15)00000HighLong-term effective rate (7)00000HighLong-term headache times (2)0−1②00−1③LowXian (2016)Acupuncture vs sham acupunctureEffective rate at 1–2 months follow-up (5)000−1①0ModerateEffective rate at 3–4 months follow-up (6)000−1①0ModerateEffective rate at 5–6 months follow-up (5)0−1②0−1①0LowEffective rate of more than 6 months follow-up (2)0−1②00−1③LowAcupuncture vs western medicineEffective rate at 1–2 months follow-up (4)0−1②00−1③LowEffective rate at 3–4 months follow-up (2)0−1②00−1③Very lowEffective rate at 5–6 months follow-up (5)0−1②0−1①−1③Very lowEffective rate of 0–1 months follow-up (2)0−1②0−1①−1③Very lowZhao (2016)Acupuncture vs western medicineEffective rate (8)0−1②000ModerateXu (2018)Acupuncture vs western medicineEffective rate (6)000−1①0ModerateOpen in a separate window ①The optimal information size was not enough. ②I2 value of the combined results was large, and/or confidence intervals overlapped difference. ③Suspicion of publishing bias.3.8. Safety of Acupuncture for MigraineOf all the 15 SRs, 8 SRs [26, 30, 31, 33–37] mentioned the adverse events of acupuncture in the treatment of migraine. 2 SRs [30, 36] did not further analyze the safety evaluation due to the small number of studies. 6 SRs [26, 31, 33–35, 37] concluded that acupuncture treatment had fewer adverse events than medication, which indicated that acupuncture was a safe therapy for migraine. 4. Discussion4.1. Summary of Main FindingsThis is the first overview of SRs that investigate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for migraine. We rigorously appraised the published SRs with AMSTAR 2, ROBIS, PRISMA-A, and GRADE. Based on AMSTAR 2, 14 out of 15 SRs were rated critically low quality and 1 was rated low quality. By using the ROBIS tool, 9 SRs were rated low risk bias. With PRISMA-A checklist, we found 11 out of 15 SRs were found adequately reported over 70%. The results of GRADE suggested that acupuncture was is an effective and safe method for migraine.4.2. Implications for Further StudyThis overview presents several challenges for producers of SRs that should be considered. By using the ROBIS tool, we found that the risk of bias in domain 2 and domain 4 of phase 2 were relatively high. In domain 2, we focused on the risk of bias in identification and selection of studies. The results indicated that the reviewers of SR should pay attention to whether the search includes an appropriate range of databases or electronic sources for published reports. Instead of database searching, the additional methods should also be used to identify relevant reports, including conference reports and clinical trial registration platforms. In domain 4, the risk of bias in synthesis of findings was high. Even though the data was synthesized in all the SRs, we were not able to determine whether data synthesis and analysis methods have been followed in advance, which may ignore the results of some studies. The robustness of the findings should be assessed through funnel plot or sensitivity analyses, and the biases in primary studies should be minimized or addressed in the synthesis.The PRISMA-A statement provided the basis for the author to improve the reporting quality of the SRs with acupuncture as intervention. According to the results of the PRISMA score, the lowest report rate (13.33%) was in the protocol and registration section. Only 2 SRs managed to offer a protocol or registration number of SR. An advance registration helps promote transparency, minimize potential bias in the conducting and reporting review, reduce duplication of effort between groups, and keep SRs updated. [39] A free and open database, the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero), has been advocated and recommended for reviewers to avoid bringing bias in SRs. In order to achieve a better quality of evidence, the researchers need to strictly control the risk of bias with reference to the ROBIS tool when conducting SRs/meta-analyses. In accordance with the requirements of the PRISMA-A statement, writing a SR/meta-analysis helps to get better reporting quality.In the assessment of evidence quality with GRADE tool, we found that the biggest reason for downgrading was inconsistencies among studies, owing to the high I2 value and statistically significant heterogeneity of effect estimates. The GRADE guideline suggests, when it comes to inconsistency, SR authors should generate and test a small number of a priori hypotheses related to patients, interventions, outcomes, and methodology to explore the sources of heterogeneity [40].4.3. Strength and LimitationsThere are some strength in our study; firstly, this overview is the first to systematically evaluated the methodological quality and reporting quality of SRs in acupuncture for migraine. Secondly, we combined the latest high-quality evidence of SRs to provide a more convinced evidence for clinical work. Thirdly, we started this overview with a predesigned protocol, which helped reduce the risk of bias.In addition to the strengths, there are several limitations to be noted. Firstly, there might be some missing information since we only gathered studies in English and Chinese. Secondly, we were unable to synthesize all the evidence, which may decrease the accuracy of the conclusions. 5. ConclusionsBased on high quality of evidence, we conclude that acupuncture is more effective and safer than medication or sham acupuncture in the treatment of migraine. However, the methodological quality, risk of bias, and reporting quality of SRs in acupuncture for migraine still needs improvement in future.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/29501470/,"INTRODUCTIONNearly all adults with Down Syndrome (DS) will develop Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology starting in their thirties. Based on a current lifespan of 55 to 60 years, approximately 70% will develop AD, a number that will grow with increased life expectancy (1). It is difficult to identify early signs of AD related dementia in adults with DS. However, deficits in cognitive control and features of frontotemporal dementia are thought to be early indicators of dementia in this group (2–6). Previous research has identified that increased physical activity (PA), may limit declines, or improve cognitive control in individuals with early dementia, thus improving quality of life (6).Recent studies suggest that increased PA may be important for maintaining components of cognition, including attention, memory, and executive control, in patients with AD (7–16). For example, Ruscheweyh et al (17) conducted a six-month intervention where 62 healthy older adults were randomized to a moderate intensity PA intervention (nordic walking), low-intensity PA intervention (gymnastics) or a control group. The two exercise intervention groups met for 50 minutes 3/week across the 6-month study. Results found that memory scores improved in both the low and moderate intensity intervention groups, but not the control group.Similarly, research has also shown that PA may improve cognitive function in adults with DS (18–21), who are at risk for AD. For example, Chen et al.(19) conducted a study in 20 adults with DS in which 10 adults walked one time on a treadmill for 20 minutes at moderate intensity, and the other 10 watched a video. There was significant improvement in inhibition (p=0.03) in the adults with DS who completed the single bout of moderate activity compared to those who watched the video. Similarly, Pastula and colleagues (19) completed an 8-week moderate intensity exercise-training program in 14 young adults with DS. Participants completed ~30 minute moderate-intensity circuit-training workouts 3 times a week. The intervention resulted in a significant improvement in aerobic fitness (p<0.002) and perceptual and mental speed (p<0.002). Together, these findings suggest that participation in moderate intensity exercise may produce improvements in cognition in individuals with DS. However, additional research is needed.A recently completed trial examining the feasibility of group exercise session delivered remotely to young adults with DS, across 12-weeks afforded us the opportunity to conduct a secondary analysis to evaluate changes in cognitive function in adults with DS who attended 30- minute group exercise session either one or two times per week. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of a 12-week moderate PA program on changes in cognitive function in adults with DS without dementia. METHODSOverview of study designAdults with DS participated in a 12-week, at home, group exercise program delivered by video conferencing (Zoom Inc., San Jose, CA) on an iPad mini tablet computer (Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA). This study took place in the (Blinded for Review) metropolitan area from December 2015–July 2016. Participants were randomized to receive the group activity sessions for 30 minutes, either once or twice per week to determine the optimal dosage of weekly sessions needed to see changes in cognitive function. To examine changes in cognitive function, a battery of cognitive tests was assessed pre-and post-intervention. A detailed method, attendance to group sessions, and PA obtained in the sessions has previously been reported (citation blinded For Review). This study was approved by the Human Subjects Committee at the (Blinded For Review).ParticipantsParticipants were men and women, 18–35 years of age with a diagnosis of Down syndrome, as verified by their primary care physician. Participants over the age of 35 were excluded as they may have already begun to develop dementia. Additional inclusion criteria included: 1) Functional ability sufficient to understand directions, ability to communicate through spoken language, 2) Reside in a supported living condition either at home or with no more than 1–4 residents and have a caregiver. 3) Wireless Internet access in the home. 4) Ability to participate in PA verified by physician consent. Participant exclusion criteria included: 1) Currently pregnant, planning on becoming pregnant during the study. 2) Participation in a regular exercise program, defined as greater than 500 kcal/wk. of planned activity as estimated by questionnaire (22).Recruitment proceduresParticipants were recruited through local community programs serving adults DS and with print and web advertisements in the target area. Home visits were scheduled with potential participants and their legal guardian (if applicable) to obtain written consent or legal guardian consent and participant assent. Participants were randomized by computer into either the once a week group or twice a week group with equal allocation between groups.InterventionThirty-minute sessions were delivered via video conferencing either one or two times per week over 12 weeks to groups of 5–8 participants, each in their own home. Group video conferencing was chosen as this approach requires no travel commitment from care providers or parents, and offers the potential for peer support and socialization. Additional details regarding the rational for this approach have been previously published (23).A health educator, who was a specialist in adapted physical education and experienced in working with adults with DS, led the exercise sessions. The 1 session/week and 2 sessions/week groups were conducted separately but led by the same health educator. Sessions consisted of a 5-minute warm-up, 20 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity PA (i.e., 3–6 METs), and a 5-minute cool-down period. Exercise intensity increased progressively across the first 6 weeks of the intervention and then remained steady weeks 7–12.OutcomesThe intensity and duration of all group exercise sessions were assessed with a Fitbit monitor worn on the non-dominate wrist during all group exercise sessions.Cognitive function was assessed using the Cantab Dementia Battery for iPad at baseline and 12-weeks. This battery assesses all cognitive domains including: processing speed, psychomotor speed, sustained attention, visual episodic memory, working memory, and cognitive control. In addition to numerous AD specific trials (24, 25), this battery has also been used in several DS trials (26, 27). The specific cognitive tests administered were the attention switching task, paired associates learning, and reaction time.Attention Switching Task (AST) is a measure of attention and cognitive flexibility. For this task, the test displayed an arrow which could appear on either side of the screen and point in either direction. Each trial displayed a cue at the top of the screen that indicated to the participant whether they had to select the right or left button according to the “side on which the arrow appeared” or the “direction in which the arrow was pointing”. Some trials displayed congruent stimuli (e.g. arrow on the right side pointing to the right) whereas other trials display incongruent stimuli “switching”, which requires a higher cognitive demand (e.g. arrow on the right side of the screen pointing to the left). Two AST measurements were collected. AST 1 measured the median latency of response (from stimulus appearance to button press) in assessed block(s) in which the rule is switching. Higher scores indicate worse performance. AST 2 measured the median latency of response (from stimulus appearance to button press) on congruent trials. Higher scores indicate worse performance.Paired Associates Learning (PAL) assesses visual memory and new learning. For this task boxes were displayed on the screen and were “opened” in a randomized order. One or more of them contained a pattern. The patterns were then displayed in the middle of the screen, one at a time and the participant had to select the box in which the pattern was originally located. If the participant made an error, the boxes were opened in sequence again to remind the participant of the locations of the patterns. Two PAL measurements were collected. PAL 1 assessed is the number of times the subject chose the incorrect box for a stimulus on assessment problems. Higher scores indicate worse performance. PAL 2 measured the number of correct box choices that were made on the first attempt during assessment problems. Higher scores indicate better performance.Reaction time (RTI) provides assessments of motor and mental response speeds, as well as measures of movement time, reaction time, response accuracy and impulsivity. For this assessment the participant selected and held a button at the bottom of the screen. Circles were presented above. In each case, a yellow dot appeared in one of the circles, and the participant was asked to react as soon as possible, releasing the button at the bottom of the screen, and selecting the circle in which the dot appeared. Two reaction time tests were measured. RTI 1 measured the median duration between the onset of the stimulus and the release of the button. Higher scores indicate worse performance. RTI 2 measured the mean time taken to touch the stimulus after the button has been released. Higher scores indicate worse performance.Statistical AnalysisSample demographics and all outcome measures were summarized by descriptive statistics—means, standard deviations, and 95% confidence limits for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. General linear mixed models (intention-to-treat), was used to assess for the impact of number of exercise sessions/week (1 session versus 2 sessions), time (treated as a categorical variable; baseline, 12-weeks), and the group-by-time interaction effects on cognitive function outcomes. Autoregressive and unstructured covariance structures were tested and unstructured covariance was used as the −2 restricted log likelihood was smaller. Analyses were adjusted for baseline measures: age, education level, race/ethnicity, BMI, number of support staff, and number of individuals living at home. The estimated marginal mean change in each cognitive function task score for 1 or 2-session/per week groups was calculated using general linear mixed models. Cohen’s d effect sizes were calculated using the unstandardized mean change scores (12 weeks - baseline) and the pooled standard deviations (28). Effect sizes are interpreted as d = 0.20 (small), d = 0.50 (medium), and d = 0.80 (large) (28). Statistical significance was determined at 0.05 alpha level and all analyses were performed using SAS Software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). RESULTSParticipantsTwenty-seven participants enrolled in the study, and all participants completed both the baseline and 12-week outcomes assessments. The sample included 40.7% females, and 10.1% minorities with a mean age of 27.9 years.

Adjusted for age, education level, race/ethnicity, BMI, number of support staff, number living at home.Paired Associates LearningResults for the paired associates learning tasks are presented in Table 2. Main effects for time were found for Paired Associates Learning 1 (p=0.048). Regardless of group assignment, both groups had decreased scores over 12 weeks. Main effects for time approached significance for Paired Associates Learning 2 (p=0.069). At 12 weeks, the difference between the 1 session/week group and 2 session/week group approached statistical significance (Paired Associates Learning 1 = 0.054; Paired Associates Learning 2 = 0.052). This suggests that the 2 sessions/week group had greater improvements in paired associate learning compared to the 1 session/week group. Effect sizes were large for the Paired Associates Learning 1 (d=0.76) and for the Paired Associates Learning 2 (d=0.82).Reaction TimeResults of the linear mixed model analyses for the reaction time tasks showed no significant group, time, or group-by-time interaction effects. Medium effect sizes for the for number of exercise sessions/week on attention switching tasks were demonstrated (Reaction Time Task 1 = 0.32; Reaction Time Task 2 = 0.43; Table 2). DISCUSSIONResearch suggests that PA may limit declines or improve cognitive function in individuals with DS, a population at high risk for AD(6). Our results found that individuals who attended 2 sessions per week improved their performance on both of the Paired Associates Learning tasks, which assess memory, after 12-week of a PA intervention. To our knowledge no previous studies have examined the relationship between PA and memory in individuals with DS. However, previous research in older adults without DS have found similar improvements in memory after a PA intervention (17, 29). For example Ruscheweyh et al (17) found that memory scores improved in older adults who were prescribed 150 minutes per week of either low or moderate intensity PA. Together these results suggest that PA may be beneficial to improve or prevent loss of memory in individuals with DS. While the exploration of the mechanism by which PA may impact memory in individuals with DS is necessary, previous research suggests that positive memory changes are associated with increases in local gray matter volume in the prefrontal and cingulate cortex, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDFN) levels as a result of increased PA (17).While there were no significant changes across time or between groups in attention or reaction time, participants randomized to the 2 sessions/week group saw improvements in attention switching task 1 and in both of the reaction time variables. The 1 session/week group, only saw an improvement in one attention variable, with scores declining in both reaction time variables. Similarly, Pastula and colleagues (19) observed significant improvement in decision speed and mental processing speed, which are similar to reaction time and attention, respectively. Chen at (21), found that adults with DS who completed moderate-intensity PA demonstrated improvements in reaction time, while those who did vigorous intensity had impaired scores. Together these results indicate that increased PA may lead to improvements in attention and reaction time, but additional research on the dosage and intensity is warranted.Our results suggest that increased PA may have positive changes on cognitive function. However, this study is limited by a small sample (n= 27) of mostly white (89%) adults with DS, who were incentivized to participate in a short-term (12 week) trial. Additionally, this study was not powered to detect changes in cognitive function task scores. Therefore, these results should be interpreted cautiously. Next, we did not include a non-exercise control group to which we could have compared the cognitive changes of those who did group PA to those who did not. An additional limitation is that minutes of PA were only obtained from group exercise sessions, and thus, the relationship between weekly minutes of PA (including activities of daily living) and cognitive function was not examined. Finally, this study required participants to have Internet in their home, which may limit the generalizability of these results.In summary, our results suggest some evidence that obtaining higher amounts of PA from group exercise sessions, may improve cognitive function, especially memory, in adults with DS. While adequately powered trials to further evaluate the relationship between PA and cognitive function over longer time frames (e.g. ≥ 6 months) are warranted, those working with adults with DS should promote increases in PA. Future research should concentrate on examining the long-term changes in cognitive function between those receiving a PA intervention compared to a non-exercise control group, as well as examining the dosage and intensity of weekly PA needed to see changes in cognitive function.",introductionnearli adult syndrom   d   develop alzheim diseas   ad   patholog start thirti   base current lifespan 55 60

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/32587940/,"Is there a doctor on-board? One in 604 flights will have a medical emergency.1 With 87,000 flights per day in the United States, that is ∼144 medical emergencies per day. Most commonly in-flight medical emergency complaints include syncope (33%), gastrointestinal (15%), respiratory (10%), and cardiovascular (7%) complaints.2 Although the duty to respond by health care professionals varies by country, medical providers are covered in the United States by the Aviation Medical Assistance Act,3 which provides Good Samaritan coverage for the health care provider, unless there is gross negligence.Unfortunately, there have been several stories that have highlighted the bias that exists when a person of color or a woman comes to the aid of a person in distress while in-flight. In the era of social media, some of these stories receive not only local attention, but some stories have also reached a level of national and international prominence.4–6 They evoke a conversation about the role of racism and gender inequality when physicians who represent these demographics volunteer to offer their assistance. We highlight three stories of women physicians of color who attempted to assist passengers during in-flight medical emergencies.In 2016, on a flight from Detroit to Houston, T.K.C., an obstetrics-gynecology resident physician, raised her hand to help a passenger who was unresponsive. She was immediately met with resistance. The Delta flight attendant said, “Oh wow, you're an actual physician? Let me see your credentials. What type of doctor are you? Where do you work? Why were you in Detroit?”The flight attendant would not allow her to assist. As a resident physician, she did not have a medical license to prove her medical degree. Later, a white male passenger who stated he was a physician approached the flight attendant. The flight attendant turned to T.K.C. and said, “Thanks for your help, but he can help us, and he has his credentials.” The man never showed any credentials.T.K.C. shared her experience of racial bias on social media, igniting the hashtag #whatadoctorlookslike to challenge the stereotypes many women of color face. She also spent 2 months after the event convincing Delta executives to change their policies. Delta announced, effective December 1, 2016, the company would no longer require verification of medical credentials from health care professionals helping on-board medical flight emergencies and pledged to train its frontline employees on “inclusion training.” T.K.C.'s experience spurred a national conversation and served as a launchpad for policy surrounding her struggle to deliver timely care to a person mid-flight.In October 2018, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act of 2018 was passed by Congress. In Section 407, it requires “The Comptroller General to report to Congress within the next six months on each air carrier's training policy for its employees and contractors regarding racial, ethnic, and religious nondiscrimination.”7 The section requires the Secretary of Transportation to “develop and disseminate to air carriers best practices necessary to improve”7 nondiscrimination training secondary to recent events that cast a doubt upon equity in treatment of passengers on commercial airline carriers.Immediately after the passage of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 at the end of October in 2018, F.C.S. was on a Delta flight from Indianapolis to Boston when a woman required medical assistance in-flight. F.C.S. began helping the patient seated next to her. One flight attendant asked whether she was a physician. She replied yes, and immediately produced her medical license from her wallet. As she continued to assist the patient, a second flight attendant approached and once again asked whether she was a physician. Just as she had done before, she produced her medical license. After a few minutes, she was approached by both flight attendants. The first flight attendant asked “Are you a head doctor? Confused by what a “head doctor” was, she stated “I am unsure what you mean by “head doctor.” Then the second flight attendant immediately asked, “Are you actually an M.D.? Is this your license?” She replied to the flight attendant saying, “Why would I carry someone else's medical license?”Like T.K.C., F.C.S. took to social media to share her story and showcase the in-flight racism she experienced trying to help a passenger in need. Delta replied saying this was a partner airline, and they would make sure employees were aware of their policy that did not require health care professionals to show proof of credentials.Just 6 weeks after F.C.S.'s incident, C.S. was on a United Airlines flight from Denver to Houston. She heard someone fall to the ground and immediately rushed to help. Remembering the experiences of T.K.C. and F.C.S., she was careful to announce she was an emergency medicine physician three separate times to the flight attendants. The flight attendant would not allow her to assist the patient lying on the ground in the aisle until she showed her medical credentials. C.S. proceeded to care for the patient, despite the objections of the flight attendant. After the patient was escorted off the flight by paramedics, the flight attendant came to C.S.'s seat to obtain her credentials. The flight attendant said to C.S., “[You] acted like you knew what you were doing, so I thought you probably were a doctor, so it was ok with me to have you show your credentials after.”C.S. shared her story with her local news outlet and social media, reigniting a national conversation about the biases women physicians of color face when helping passengers in-flight. Implicit Versus Explicit BiasExplicit bias is defined as “when a person is aware of his/her evaluation of a group, believes that evaluation to be correct in some manner, and has the time and motivation to act on it in the current situation.”8 It is generally deemed socially unacceptable and is not tolerated in most situations. However, implicit bias is more unconscious and subtle. “[It] does not require the perceiver to endorse it or devote attention to its expression…bias can be activated quickly and unknowingly by situational cues (e.g., a person's skin color or accent), silently exerting its influence on perception, memory, and behavior.”8 Are the aforementioned vignettes implicit versus explicit bias? It is often difficult to tell; however, there are ways in which both can be addressed by health care professionals and the aviation industry.The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 is a first step in acknowledging the racial/ethnic, and gender discrimination that was apparent in the interactions of these three female physicians. National organizations and congressional leaders have drawn attention to the discrimination passengers experience on flights. However, more should be done to address explicit and implicit biases, which affect the quality of care (timeliness of response, delayed intervention, etc.) passengers receive while in-flight (Table 1).Table 1.Health Care Professional and Aviation Industry Potential Strategies to Address Bias in In-Flight EmergenciesWhat health care professionals can do: Speak up. When injustices happen in-flight, use social media, news outlets, and organized professional medical organizations to speak out about the situation. Change cannot happen without first raising awareness of the situation. Help if help is needed. Put the needs of the patient first and foremost. If you are able to assist, do so first, as time can be critical in caring for a sick person. Carry your medical license or credentials. This is a secondary measure. Carry proof of your credentials in your wallet or in your smartphone. Engage in conversations with your colleagues about implicit and explicit bias. Everyone has biases. If we do not address these openly and honestly whenever we encounter these biases, whether it is at the grocery store or in the airplane, we will never counter these attitudes and behaviors. When you or someone else experiences bias, call it what it is. Discrimination and bias continue to exist because we are afraid to be controversial or stand up for ourselves. Stand up for others when you see someone engaging in a discriminatory practice. Recognize and change your own biases. Whether they are implicit or explicit, take the time to explore what drives your own perceptions of stereotypes, judgments, and biases when interacting with others. Come up with a plan on how to overcome these biases. Serve as an ally. If you are a person from a more privileged group (i.e. white male), speak up against injustices. Persons from these groups have a powerful voice to help drive change.What the aviation industry can do: Move beyond cursory “inclusion and diversity training.” Addressing people's implicit and explicit biases will not be corrected in a brief training. This commitment to change has to be an ongoing discussion and dialogue to change the pervasiveness of the discrimination that occurs daily. Train flight crews to see and address implicit and explicit biases. While in-flight, flight attendants are entrusted with providing service and assisting passengers to have a carefree aviation experience. They can use the power they have been granted to address and recognize bias and ensure in-flight medical emergencies are handled in the best possible manner. Develop and implement plans to address discriminatory practices from flight crews. Recognition and awareness are the first steps for change. Understanding how these situations occur and equipping teams with plans to prevent this from arising are key. Data analysis and appropriate feedback to flight crew members. When situations arise, track these data, provide appropriate and timely response to passenger concerns. Standardize protocols to remove barriers for assistance. Ensure all flight crews are up-to-date on how an in-flight medical emergency should be handled. Accept verbal confirmation of profession and willingness to assist. Medical professionals, unless committing gross negligence, are covered by Good Samaritan laws. Allow them to assist the patient first; complete the paperwork second. Preregister medical professionals at the time of buying their tickets if they are inclined to help in the case of an in-flight medical emergency. This voluntary measure may help alleviate questions regarding one's credentials.Open in a separate windowCommercial aviation is one of the safest modes of transportation because it has used data, training, advanced technology, regulations, and closed-loop communication to make airplanes safe. We challenge the aviation industry to (1) make passengers feel safe, valued, and equally important; (2) not tolerate instances of discrimination; and (3) let physicians do our job and care for patients in need.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/32131894/,"AbstractBackgroundIf transport under ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) from an upper floor is indicated, the ideal CPR-method and evacuation route is unknown hitherto. We aimed to elaborate a strategy for evacuation of patients under ongoing CPR from an upper floor, comparing three different evacuation routes and manual and mechanical chest compressions.MethodsA CPR-training manikin recording CPR-quality was placed on the fifth floor and was evacuated to an ambulance via lift, turntable ladder, or staircase. Chest compressions were performed manually or with a mechanical CPR-device. Efficiency endpoints were compression depth and frequency, sufficiency of chest release, compared with European Resuscitation Council (ERC) Guidelines, and duration of the evacuation. Adverse outcomes were disconnection/dislocation of devices and hazards/accidents to the personnel.ResultsFor all evacuation routes, compression depth and frequency were significantly more compliant with ERC-guidelines under mechanical CPR. Manual CPR was associated with considerable deviations from correct compression depth and frequency. Chest release only slightly differed between groups. Evacuation via lift under mechanical CPR was fastest and evacuation via turntable ladder under manual CPR was slowest. No device disconnections or accidents occurred, but hazard to personnel was perceived during evacuation via ladder under manual CPR.ConclusionsIn this study, a mechanical CPR-device proved to deliver better CPR-quality during evacuation from an upper floor. If a lift accessible with a stretcher is available, this route should be preferred, regardless of manual or mechanical CPR. Turntable ladders can only be meaningfully used with mechanical CPR, otherwise CPR-quality is poor and hazard to the personnel is increased. Not all evacuation routes may be useable in a specific real-life scenario.Trial registrationGerman Clinical Trials Registry, www.drks.de, registration number DRKS00012885, registration date 17.08.2017.Keywords: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, Emergency medical services, Transport under ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation, Fire service, Mechanical chest compressions BackgroundOut-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is usually treated by performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on scene until return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is achieved or until a decision is taken to terminate CPR in physician-staffed emergency medical services (EMS). Transport to a hospital under ongoing CPR is rare in such systems. In selected cases, however, transporting the patient still in cardiac arrest to a hospital for causal treatment of a potentially reversible cause of cardiac arrest is warranted [1, 2]. Some EMS-systems prefer establishing extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eCPR) by implanting a veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) on scene [3], whereas other concepts recommend transporting the patient to the hospital under ongoing CPR and establishing ECMO in-hospital [1]. Performing high-quality CPR during transport (consisting of evacuation from the scene to the ambulance, drive to the hospital, and transfer to treatment facility therein) can be challenging. Several aspects have to be considered to decide on the optimal transport modalities, including possibility and potential quality of chest compressions, length and speed of transport, required alterations of patients’ position, required personnel and material, as well as hazards to EMS-staff. In order to deliver high-quality chest compressions and to reduce risks of injury to the personnel during patient transport, mechanical CPR devices can potentially be helpful, even though their use has not proven to be superior to manual CPR and is therefore not recommended for standard CPR in a static situation [4–8]. Additionally, there is a debate about the possibly increased risk of patient injury related to mechanical chest compression devices. To evacuate patients under ongoing CPR from an upper floor, technical and personal assistance from the fire service is usually helpful and close cooperation between EMS and the fire service is crucial. In this study, we sought to establish the optimal strategy for evacuation of a simulated patient under ongoing CPR from the fifth floor. To this end, evacuation via lift, turntable ladder, or staircase was tested, using either manual or mechanical CPR. MethodsRegistration and ethical approvalThe study was registered in the German Clinical Trials Registry (Deutsches Register für Klinische Studien, www.drks.de, registration number 00012885) and ethical approval was obtained from the institutional ethics committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Cologne (approval number 17–301).Study participantsThis study was integrated into the compulsory annual training of paramedics at the fire brigade of the city of Brühl, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The participants were 40 (33 male, 7 female) paramedics of different qualifications (19 Rettungssanitäter [lower qualification, similar to EMT in many US states], 17 Rettungsassistenten [traditional higher qualification, similar to AEMT in many US states] and 4 Notfallsanitäter [new higher qualification, similar to AEMT in many US states] in the German system), between 18 and 60 years of age. They had been informed about the planned scientific evaluation of the training and agreed to participate. No data related to individual participants was collected during the study.Experimental setupDue to the rareness of the scenario in real life and lack of comparability between potential incident scenes, we chose a manikin study design. A CPR-training manikin (Resusci Anne, Laerdal, Stavanger, Norway) was mounted on a spine-board, connected to a defibrillator (Corpuls C3, GS Elektromedizinische Geräte Stemple, Kaufering, Germany) and a respirator (Medumat Standard, Weinmann, Hamburg, Germany). Additional weights were attached to generate a more realistic total weight of 75 kg. Participants were divided into groups of eight (representing two ambulance staff, two emergency physician dispatch car staff, and four fire engine staff). We simulated different evacuation routes and CPR-techniques in a rotating manner, i. e. all participants performed all scenarios during the training day.To avoid bias due to exhaustion, groups took turns in participation and their roles during resuscitation. Distribution between participants of higher and lower training grades was balanced. Blinding of the participants was not possible. Due to obvious differences in the results observed between manual and mechanical CPR, blinding of data analysts would not have been reasonably possible, either. Each experiment was performed three to five times. The intended number of executions of each scenario was five, there was one dropout in the lift/manual group due to unavailability of the lift, two in the ladder/mechanical group (one due to unavailability of the ladder, one due to a failure of data registration in the SimPad), and one in the stairs/mechanical group due to a failure of data registration in the SimPad (Fig. 1). Open in a separate windowFig. 1Flowchart of the study setupIn the groups allocated to mechanical CPR, a piston-based CPR-device (Corpuls CPR, GS Elektromedizinische Geräte Stemple) of the EMS of the fire brigade of Brühl was applied. The so-equipped manikin was placed on the floor of an apartment in the fifth floor (UK numbering) of a retirement home. As the aim of our study was to investigate duration and quality of CPR during the evacuation from the building, we measured these parameters from the time of lifting the spine board until arrival at an ambulance parked in front of the building. CPR-events before the start of evacuation, such as endotracheal intubation or attachment of the CPR-device, were not part of the study.For evacuation via lift, the manikin was lifted on an ambulance stretcher (Stryker M-1, Stryker, Kalamazoo (MI), USA) and transported via a stretcher accessible lift. Participants were free to perform CPR either while walking beside the stretcher or squatting on it. For evacuation via staircase, the spine-board was carried through a large staircase under ongoing CPR. For evacuation via turntable ladder, the upper part of the stretcher was mounted on the stretcher swivel support of the rescue cage of a turntable ladder (DLK 23/12, Magirus, Ulm, Germany) (Additional file 1: photography 1). One firefighter wearing a security harness stayed in the rescue cage and performed chest compressions in the manual CPR group.Endpoints of the studyCPR quality was directly measured using a resuscitation training manikin with digital quantification and recording of all CPR measures. Efficiency endpoints were compression depth, frequency of compressions, residual compression of the chest between each compression as a measure of leaning on the chest, and duration of the evacuation. Adverse outomes were disconnection or gross dislocation of the intravenous line, respirator, defibrillator or CPR-device as well as accidents or perceived dangers (subjective measure by the participants and an additional observer) to the personnel during the evacuation.Data collectionDuration of evacuation and data on CPR-quality were recorded by a tablet computer (SimPad, Laerdal) connected to the CPR-manikin. Data was extracted from the software provided by the manufacturer (SimView, Laerdal) and transferred to Microsoft Excel for further analysis. Compression depth was measured by the device, registered by the software of the manikin and displayed in 1 mm intervals. Accuracy, according to the manufacturer, is ±15% or 3 mm. Compression frequency was calculated from the time elapsed between two compressions, thus representing a beat-to-beat frequency analysis, not the mean value within a longer (e. g. one minute) time frame. Statistical analysis and graphical layout were performed with Graph Pad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, San Diego (CA), USA). For comparisons between two groups, the Mann Whitney test was used. For comparison between two independent variables and their interaction, two-way ANOVA was used. A p-value of < 0.05was considered statistically significant. ResultsCompression depthThe compression depth recommended by the guidelines of the ERC is 50 to 60 mm. In our study, compression depth was significantly lower in all manual groups compared with the respective mechanical groups (Fig. 2a, Table 1). Among the manual compression groups, the lowest median compression depth was observed during evacuation via ladder. Especially during the phase of actual movement of the ladder from the fifth floor to the ground, compression depths were low (Additional file 2: Figure S1). The percentage of compression with a depth of 50 to 60 mm, as recommended by current guidelines, was higher with mechanical CPR in all groups (Fig. 2b, Table 1) than with manual CPR, which yielded a lower percentage of correct compression depth. Additionally, in the mechanical groups those compressions not in the target range were almost all very close to its lower end of 50 mm (Additional file 2: Figure S1). Two-way ANOVA showed a statistically significant influence of CPR-method (manual versus mechanical, p < 0.001) but not evacuation route (p = 0.55) on compression depth, and no interaction between CPR-method and evacuation route (p = 0.64).

In our study, wide variations of compression frequency were measured in all manual groups whereas a frequency close to the prescribed 100/min was maintained in all mechanical groups (Fig. 3a, Table 2). The percentage of compressions of a frequency of 100 to 120 per minute, as recommended by current guidelines, was very high in the mechanical groups, mediocre in the lift/manual and ladder/manual, and lowest in the stairs/manual group (Fig. 3b, Table 2). Particularly long hands-off-times were observed in the manual ladder evacuation group during loading the spine-board onto the ladder basket. Here, repetitive interruptions of up to five seconds each occurred (Additional file 2: Figure S1). Two-way ANOVA showed a statistically significant influence of CPR-method (p < 0.001) but not evacuation route (p = 0.27) on compression frequency, and no interaction between CPR-method and evacuation route (p = 0.28).

In our study, insufficient chest release between compressions varied between groups with a pattern less clear than for compression depth or frequency. For lift and ladder, residual compression of the chest as a measure of insufficient release was more prominent in the manual groups, whereas during evacuation via the staircase, there was more insufficient chest release in the mechanical group (Fig. 4, Table ​Table3).3). Two-way ANOVA showed no statistically significant influence of CPR-method (p = 0.9) or evacuation route (p = 0.33) on residual compression, and no interaction between CPR-method and evacuation route (p = 0.09).

For each evacuation route, evacuation with mechanical CPR was numerically shorter but these differences did not reach statistical significance in the separate analyses of each evacuation route (p = 0.127–0.257) (Fig. 5). In the overall analysis of all experiments with two-way ANOVA a statistically significant influence was found for CPR-method (p = 0.04), but not for evacuation route (p = 0.23) or for interaction between both (p = 0.76). Open in a separate windowFig. 5Duration (in seconds) of transport from the fifth floor to the ambulance in front of the building. Means and standard deviation (SD)Adverse outcomesNo disconnections of any device occurred; gross dislocations of the CPR-device were not observed while slight dislocations could not be ruled out by the experimental setup. There were no accidents to the personnel or bystanders. Perceived danger as reported by the participants and the observer to the firefighters performing manual CPR in the turntable ladder basket was high, especially when mounting on the metal bars of the basket to increase efficiency of chest compressions (Additional file 3: photography 2). DiscussionWe have compared three different evacuation routes and two different CPR-techniques during evacuation under ongoing CPR from a flat in the fifth floor. For all evacuation routes, mechanical chest compressions were found to provide superior CPR-quality in terms of compression depth and frequency. Using a CPR-device, no significant differences in CPR-quality could be detected for evacuation via lift (accessible with a stretcher), turntable ladder, or staircase. For manual chest compressions, particularly poor CPR-quality as well as hazards to the staff were observed during evacuation via turntable ladder. The best results for manual CPR were obtained during evacuation via lift.Poor manual CPR-quality while moving patients is in accordance with prior publications that studied CPR-quality during other phases of the overall patient transport, e.g. in an ambulance or a helicopter [9–11]. While human and manikin studies focused on “technical” parameters of CPR-quality, such as compression depth and frequency and hands-off-time, a recent trial in a porcine model analysed haemodynamic parameters during manual or mechanical CPR in a moving ambulance. Mechanical resuscitation with the LUCAS-device resulted in higher coronary perfusion pressure, higher end-tidal CO2 and lower lactate levels than manual chest compressions [12].To the best of our knowledge, the phase of transport looked at here – evacuation from a flat in a upper floor to the ambulance – has not been studied in detail yet.One manikin trial compared CPR-quality with manual or mechanical (LUCAS-device) CPR during transport from a second floor to the hospital, thus including the phase analysed here. The only evacuation route in that study was the staircase. Mechanical CPR was found to result in a higher percentage of compressions with adequate depth (LUCAS 52% vs. manual 36%, p < 0.07) and rate (LUCAS 71% vs. manual 40%, p < 0.02) during the overall transport. A separate analysis of the phase of evacuation through the staircase is not available [13].A patient trial analysed manual and mechanical (AutoPulse-device) CPR while moving the patient on a flexible extrication sheet from the site of collapse into the ambulance. No information concerning the sites of collapse is available, so the percentage of patients evacuated from a building, as compared with those evacuated from e. g. a nearby pavement, is unknown. The range of 32 to 540 s for the extrication suggests a diversity of locations. In the manual-CPR-group, chest compressions were interrupted for a median of 270 s versus 39 s in the AutoPulse-group [14].OHCA in upper floors appears to be related to lower survival rates. Besides demographic or sociological factors, this finding is linked to longer EMS response times. Whether difficulties in evacuation from the upper floors, with or without ongoing CPR, may play a role, cannot be judged from the data provided in the according publications [15, 16]. Our results suggest that in cases of transport under ongoing CPR without a CPR-device, poor CPR-quality has to be expected, possibly contributing to lower survival rates.From the findings in our study, we suggest using a CPR-device whenever the decision is taken to evacuate a patient under ongoing CPR from an upper floor. If a stretcher accessible lift is available, this route should be preferred, whether CPR be mechanical or manual. Apart from a relatively sufficient CPR-quality for manual CPR, this route avoids tilting of the patient and reduces the need for personnel and material, possibly obviating the need for support from the fire service. If the location of collapse can be accessed with a turntable ladder, this is a suitable route given the availability of a CPR-device. If this is unavailable, CPR-quality during loading and moving of the ladder as well as hazard to the staff is too high to recommend this route. Evacuation via the staircase should be avoided if possible, as it implies tilting of the patient, going along with possible risk of gross dislocation of the CPR-device (which was not observed in our experiments) and strain to personnel (which is required in large numbers). Whether for lower floors than studied here, the practicability of a short staircase transport, compared with bringing a turntable ladder into position, might outweigh these drawbacks, remains undecided from our model of evacuation from the fifth floor.It remains unclear why chest release between compressions with the Corpuls CPR-device was worse during transport via staircase compared with the other routes. One possible explanation might be slight dislocations of the piston, which is applied with a certain surface pressure at the beginning of treatment, resulting in insufficient release of the chest. Another possible reason might be an oversensitivity of the resuscitation manikin’s pressure sensor.There is a discussion about the potential of CPR devices to cause musculoskeletal or visceral injuries, such as liver or spleen lacerations. The only randomised trial of device-related injuries so far did not include the Corpuls CPR-device used in this study, but the piston-based device analysed in that study, LUCAS, was found to be non-inferior to manual CPR in terms of severe injuries [17]. By contrast, in two other recently published large studies, patients resuscitated with the LUCAS-device had more resuscitation-related injuries [18, 19], even though this effect lost statistical significance after adjusting for CPR-duration in one of the studies [18]. In case of evacuation from an upper floor, we would still suggest using CPR-devices, even if their injury potential were higher, because of the improvement of CPR-quality versus manual CPR, which performs poorly in this situation.We recognise three main limitations of this study. Firstly, a manikin study obviously does not permit the analysis of clinical endpoints, such as ROSC, survival or neurological outcome, but had to focus on “technical” parameters of CPR-quality. The low number of real cases, however, precluded the possibility to study this research question in real patients. Secondly, the number of repetitions for each experiment was low. Still, we believe that even with a limited number of repetitions our results are clear enough to support our findings and conclusions in a robust manner. Thirdly, we looked at a clearly defined, isolated phase of transports with all means and personnel readily available at the start of the experiment. In real-life-scenarios, time of attachment of the CPR-device, availability and driving time of the fire service or dimensions of lift or staircase are aspects to be considered. Time intervals such as duration from arrival at the scene to first chest compression or to starting transport to the hospital were not part of this study. Furthermore, participants and investigators were not blinded to the chest compression method and extrication route, which might potentially create a bias. However, CPR-quality during the short stationary phase of the experiment appeared comparable to the CPR-quality observed during general CPR-drills of the fire brigade. ConclusionsOur manikin study has shown that mechanical CPR is more effective to perform consistent high quality CPR during evacuation under ongoing CPR from an upper floor. Without mechanical CPR, significant deviations from guideline-recommendations were observed, particularly for evacuation via turntable ladder or stairs. If a stretcher accessible lift is available, this evacuation route offers the possibility of good CPR-quality with low personnel and technical effort. During evacuation via turntable ladder, manual CPR goes along with insufficient CPR-quality and hazards to the staff. Supplementary information Additional file 1.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/31592266/,"IntroductionYouth sport programs are recommended as child-centered physical activities.1,2 Yet, in the adult-driven, day-to-day operation of organized athletics, children’s voices are rarely central to the delivery of sport programs.3,4 Indeed, there is an absence of rigorous, systematic, scientific studies that represent children’s voices5,6 from which youth sport stakeholders can seek evidence-informed guidance when promoting positive sport experiences for youth. An area that is in need of further scientific study within the scope of positive experiences is fun.7 Importantly, fun is the primary determinant of young athletes’ sport commitment and their sustained involvement in childhood and through their adolescence.8,9 Yet, a athlete-centered reference for intentionally and systematically promoting fun did not exist until recently. Well-established theories for understanding children’s sport participation motives such as self-determination theory, achievement goal theory, and others are encapsulated in the fun integration theory’s FUN MAPS, a novel, stakeholder-derived framework for understanding the multidimensional complexity of fun within youth sport.7,10 The fun integration theory’s FUN MAPSThe fun integration theory’s FUN MAPS10 were developed from concept mapping, a type of translational research methodology that produces concept maps on a specific issue of interest.11 It involved engaging youth sport stakeholders as key informants by building consensus and understanding of all the things that make playing organized team sports fun for players. Key informants included girl and boy soccer players, aged 8–19 years playing in recreational and travel programs from a mid-Atlantic metropolitan area of the United States, along with parents and coaches. For context, recreational programs in the United States customarily provide their players with one practice and one game per week, and the central emphasis of these programs is inclusive participation (P. Shaw, Virginia Youth Soccer Association, Coaching Education Director, personal communication, February 13, 2018). Therefore, regardless of skill level, players in recreational programs play at least 50% of every game. However, travel programs are more competitive, requiring them to try-out; and, if selected, they will practice three to five times per week and play one to two games per week. According to Shaw, in the mid-Atlantic metropolitan area in which the participants of this concept-mapping study were recruited and their data collected, travel coaches typically hold more advanced coaching licenses, have more coaching experience, and are generally paid, earning as much as $5,000–$12,000 USD per team each season, whereas recreational coaches are, for the most part, unpaid, with fewer years of coaching experience and coaching education.In the development of the FUN MAPS, the players, parents, and coaches were first asked to generate as many statements (ideas) as they could by completing the focus prompt, “One thing that makes playing sports fun for players is….” Although these participants were recruited from soccer programs, 75.5% of the player participants reported involvement in other sports, either in the past or in the present.10 In an effort to ensure that statements were generalizable across as many sports as possible, players were instructed to complete the focus prompt in a way that broadly represented their participation across all of their varied, team-based sport experiences. The content of their statements were analyzed through idea synthesis in which redundant ideas were combined into a single statement and complex statements that included several ideas were apportioned so that each idea became a single, simplified statement. This resulted in 81 unique statements considered determinants of fun in organized, team-based sports. Second, to understand how the fun-determinants were inter-related, the soccer players, parents, and coaches sorted them into piles and named each pile. Third, they rated the importance of each determinant relative to all of the others. Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis were applied to the sorting and rating data generated, resulting in the data being represented in the form of three-dimensional concept maps. These maps, collectively called the FUN MAPS, display the 81 determinants grouped into the following 11 fun-factors (listed alphabetically) and were the basis for the fun integration theory: Games, Game Time Support, Learning and Improving, Mental Bonuses, Positive Coaching, Positive Team Dynamics, Practices, Swag, Team Friendships, Team Rituals, and Trying Hard.10 According to the theory, accumulated immediate behavioral-actions (the fun-determinants) derived from contextual, internal, social, and external sources (the fun-factors) coalesce to create the affective experience of fun.The youth athletes’ fun ethosAmong the fun-factors, regardless of sex, age, and level of play, the player participants generally rated the 11 fun-factors by three distinct tiers of importance.12 Listed in the order of most to least importance, specifically, Trying Hard, Positive Team Dynamics, and Positive Coaching were of primary importance; Learning and Improving, Games, Practices, Team Friendships, Mental Bonuses, and Game Time Support were of secondary importance; and Team Rituals and Swag were of tertiary importance. These findings, coined the youth athletes’ fun ethos, are a reflection of their collective prioritization of the importance of all 11 fun-factors. The uniformity of these soccer players’ fun values is also seen at the more specific fun-determinant level. Girl and boy players responded similarly for ~93% of the 81 determinants; younger and older players responded similarly for ~96% of the determinants; and finally, recreational and travel players responded similarly for ~94% of the determinants. Clearly, these players reported the importance of the fun-determinants, and thus factors were remarkably consistent across various participant demographics.Even so, players are but one stakeholder within the broader youth sport setting, and though they are the primary consumers, they also generally possess the least amount of control over the cultural norms, practices, and general operation of the programs they participate in.6 Thus, the social climate generated by adults most significantly influences the sport experiences of children.13 Parents, in particular, are an incredibly powerful influence in their children’s sport settings14 and reportedly see themselves as consumers of enduring involvement in their children’s sport participation.15–16 Meaning, parents have long-term interest in the athletic program(s) they have financially invested in for their children to play and compete. For parents, coaches are the most visible representatives of the parents’ investment because they are responsible for providing sport-specific instruction in consonance with the objectives of the athletic program.15 Therefore, coaches play a key role in the development of young athletes and influence the overall quality of their sport experiences.17,18 Consequently, a natural line of inquiry is the extent to which the importance of the 11 factors and 81 determinants, as reported by the adults responsible for supporting (parents) and delivering (coaches) programs, is congruent with athletes’ self-reported importance (i.e. the youth athletes’ fun ethos). Respectively, we conducted a secondary analysis of the fun integration theory’s FUN MAPS to determine the degree of consensus among youth soccer parents and players, as well as youth soccer coaches and players, in order to identify aspects of fun that may warrant educational and skill-based interventions that would position adult stakeholders to provide their players with soccer experiences consistent with their fun values. If, in fact, programs intended to be child-centered activities are indeed, ideally, it stands to reason that parents and coaches’ perceptions of what is fun for their athletes will be congruent with the fun values. MethodParticipantsData analyzed for the purposes of this descriptive, cross-sectional study included those provided by soccer players (n = 141, aged 8–19 years, Mage = 12.7), parents (n = 57, aged 37–60 years, Mage = 46.5), and coaches (n = 35, aged 24–78 years, Mage = 41.8) who had voluntarily participated in the original concept-mapping study that lead to the conceptualization of the FUN MAPS.10 The distribution of the three participant groups is presented in Table 1.Table 1.Participant demographics reported as N (%).Players(N = 141)Parents(N = 57)Coaches(N = 35)Sex Male72 (51.0)19 (33.0)27 (77.0) Female69 (48.9)38 (67.0)8 (23.0)Age group Younger players (U9–U13)95 (67.3)38 (66.7)19 (54.2) Older players (U14–U19)46 (32.6)19 (33.3)16 (45.8)Level of play Recreational65 (46.0)30 (53.0)16 (45.7) Travel76 (53.9)27 (47.0)19 (54.3)Open in a separate windowProcedure and data analysisThe George Washington University Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Subjects approved this study. A concept-mapping program (Concept Systems® Global MAX) was used to generate pattern-match and go-zone displays for group comparisons. SPSS version 23.0 was used for further tests of group differences.Pattern-match displays. A pattern-match display is a ladder graph, in which the relative minimum and maximum mean rating values, from a scale of 1 (not as important) to 5 (extremely important), for any two comparison groups (e.g. girls and boys) anchor the ends of the vertical axes, and the 11 “rungs” represent the mean rating for each of the 11 fun-factors. The more horizontal the rung, the higher the level of agreement there is between groups (see Figures 1 and ​and22 as examples).Open in a separate windowFigure 1.Pattern match display comparing players’ reported importance of the 11 fun-factors to adults’ perceptions of importance; numbers in brackets denote the rank order of importance from most important [1] to least important [11].*p < 0.013, **p < 0.001.Open in a separate windowFigure 2.Pattern match displays comparing players’ reported importance of the 11 fun-factors to coaches, stratified by age numbers in brackets denote the rank order of importance from most important [1] to least important [11].*p < 0.013, **p < 0.001.aCoaches of U9–U13 teams.bCoaches of U14–U19 teams.Six pattern-match displays were produced to assess between-group consensus among parents and players and among coaches and players, who were further stratified by age (e.g. younger players were U9–U13 and compared to coaches of U9–U13 teams; older players were U14–U19 and compared to coaches of U14–U19 teams) to discern possible age-related effects based on the developmental model of sport participation.19,20 Mann–Whitney U tests were run to identify which of the fun-factors (i.e. Positive Team Dynamics, Trying Hard, Positive Coaching, Learning and Improving, Game Time Support, Games, Practices, Team Friendships, Mental Bonuses, Team Rituals, and Swag) importance significantly differed between comparison groups. This non-parametric approach was applied, in part, to account for the relatively small and unbalanced samples sizes, in addition to the fact that the data were conceptualized as a discrete outcome and not continuous. The Fisher r-to-z transformation was used to determine whether consensus between parents and players, as measured by the pattern-match display’s Pearson product–moment correlation coefficient, was significantly different from the correlation observed between coaches and players. Coefficients closer to r = 1.0 denote greater congruence (agreement) between the two comparison groups. In addition, the Fisher r-to-z transformation was used to determine whether the correlation coefficient obtained from comparing younger players and coaches was significantly different from the coefficient obtained from comparing older players and coaches.Go-zone displays. Go-zone displays are bivariate graphs that can compare groups to one another across the specific 81 fun-determinants (see Figure 3 as an example). To illustrate, imagine a go-zone display comparing girl players to boy players. Girls appear on the x-axis and boys along the y-axis. For both groups, the mean rating value for each of the 81 fun-determinants is plotted in the graph. At the x- and y-axes, a line at the mean rating value for all 81 fun-determinants splits the graph into four distinct quadrants. Any one of the four quadrants can be designated a “go-zone,” based on information of interest. For example, if the objective was to identify the fun-determinants rated above average in importance by girls and boys, the quadrant in the upper right corner of the graph would be designated the “go-zone.” In this instance, those fun-determinants would be of great interest for a coach of a co-ed team because that information serves as directional indicators for how to maximize fun across all of the coach’s players, regardless of sex. Fun-determinants that were rated in the bottom left corner of the graph identify for the coach those determinants rated below average for girl players and boy players, and determinants within the other two quadrants identify those rated above average by one group and below average by the other. Thus, each quadrant provides unique and practical information about the fun-determinants contained within. In essence, go-zone displays allow a coach to make more informed decisions about how to allocate resources and plan activities that best meet the players’ sport needs.Open in a separate windowFigures 3–6.Go-zone displays comparing players’ reported Importance of the 11 fun-factors to coaches, stratified by age.aCoaches of U9–U13 teams.bCoaches of U14–U19 teams.Four go-zone displays were produced to evaluate the overall association of the perceived importance of the 81 fun-determinants between parents and players, coaches, and players as well as coaches and players stratified by age (i.e. younger players were U9–U13 and compared to coaches of U9–U13 teams; older players were U14–U19 and compared to coaches of U14–U19 teams). Similar to pattern-match displays, the overall association or relationship of the perceived importance between two comparison groups is measured by the Pearson product–moment correlation coefficient. For the purposes of this study, the “go-zones” included the upper left and lower right quadrants of the go-zone displays, because these quadrants highlighted those determinants reported above the mean for importance by one group and below the mean by the other group, thereby identifying determinants of disparate importance. Mann–Whitney U tests were used to identify which of the 81 fun-determinants groups significantly differed in their reported rating of importance. To avoid the likelihood of inflating Type 1 error, a Bonferroni correction was applied for the go-zone graphs as well as the pattern-match analyses; therefore, statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.013 (0.05/4 = 0.013). Lastly, the effect size of difference for fun-determinants that differed significantly between groups was calculated by r=Z/√N and interpreted using the following parameters: 0.1 a small effect, 0.3 a medium effect, and 0.5 a large effect.21–23 ResultsPattern-match displaysWhen comparing the mean importance rating for the 11 fun-factors, the degree of consensus between parents and players was quite high (r = 0.93; significant differences were observed for Game Time Support [p = 0.005] and Trying Hard [p ≤ 0.0001]), and examination of possible age-related effects yielded the same degree of consensus between parents and younger players (r = 0.93) and parents and older players (r = 0.93). Therefore, for parsimony, the pattern-match display using the total sample of parents and players is reported (see Figure 1). In addition to the high consensus observed between parents and players, consensus was also relatively high between coaches and players (r = 0.84; significant differences were only observed for Team Friendships [p = 0.004], Trying Hard [p ≤ 0.0001], and Team Rituals [p = 0.006]). Interestingly though, when compared to one another, the consensus observed was significantly lower (Z = 4.19, p ≤ 0.001) between coaches and players than between parents and players (see Figure 1). Furthermore, the degree of consensus for coaches and younger players (r = 0.90; significant difference observed for Trying Hard [p ≤ 0.0001]) was significantly greater (Z = 3.63, p ≤ 0.001) than the consensus indicated among coaches and older players (r = 0.71; significant differences were observed for Trying Hard [p ≤ 0.0001], Positive Coaching [p = 0.006], Game Time Support [p ≤ 0.0001], Team Friendships [p = 0.013], and Team Rituals [p = 0.002]; see Figure 2).Go-zone displaysParents and players. Figure 3 displays a high level of consensus (r = 0.89) between parents and players. When comparing the mean importance rating for each of the 81 fun-determinants, there were 23 significant mean differences (see Table 2) ranging from small to medium-effect sizes of difference (r = 0.18–0.47), of which 2 were observed in the upper left go-zone (rated above average in importance among parents and below average by players) and 3 in the bottom right go-zone (rated below average by parents and above average by players; see Table 3).Table 2.Parent–player comparisons of significant differences within the go-zone displays.Parents(n = 57)Players(n =

The go-zone comparison of coaches and players displayed in Figure 4 exhibits a lower consensus (r = 0.75) than that between players and parents (r = 0.89). When independently comparing the 81 fun-determinants’ mean importance values reported, 24 significant differences were observed (see Table 3) with small to medium effect sizes of difference (r = 0.20–0.46), of which 4 were observed in the upper left go-zone (rated above average in importance among coaches and below average by players) and 4 in the bottom right go-zone (rated below average by coaches and above average by players; see Table 3).Younger players. When comparing younger players and coaches (see Figure 5), a slightly higher consensus was observed (r = 0.77). Younger players and coaches differed significantly in their reported importance of 14 of the 81 fun-determinants, ranging from small to large effect sizes of difference (r = 0.24–0.54), of which 4 were observed in the bottom right go-zone (rated below average by coaches and above average by younger players; see Table 3).Older players. Lastly, when comparing older players to coaches (see Figure 6), a much lower consensus (r = 0.66) was observed. Older players and coaches differed significantly in their reported importance of 18 of the 81 fun-determinants, ranging from medium to large effect sizes of difference (r = 0.32–0.56), of which 7 were observed in the upper left go-zone and 1 in the bottom right go-zone (see Table 3). DiscussionMost often, adults’ frame of reference for sports is derived from their beliefs, values, perspectives, and own youth experiences, or through the lens by which they have become acculturated as an adult to youth sport values and norms.24,25 Therefore, we sought to examine parents and coaches’ perceived understanding of what is most important to players having fun and how those perceptions compare to players. Specifically, we examined youth soccer parents and coaches’ prioritization of the importance of the fun integration theory’s 11 fun-factors and 81 fun-determinants and their congruence with the youth athletes’ fun ethos. Congruence was highest among parents and players; however, among coaches and players, there were discernable differences. Interestingly, congruence was relatively higher among younger soccer players and coaches than it was compared to adolescent soccer players and coaches. We discuss these findings, in addition to exploring ways in which youth sport educators can use transformative learning theory to lead positive reform, particularly among coaches, that is athlete-centered and fun.High congruence among parents and playersThrough daily interactions and reinforcement of their children’s behavior, parents are known to be the first and most significant socializing agents in the sport environment,14 passing on their perspectives to their children.11,26 This may, in part, explain the generally high degree of congruence observed between parents and players’ comparative prioritization of the fun-factors. Of note, parents rated the fun-determinants germane to coaching behaviors and thereby the fun-factor Positive Coaching of greatest importance followed second by Positive Team Dynamics. The rank order of these findings is not unexpected because coaches are responsible for the athletic development of children and thus play a key role in the quality of young athletes’ sport experiences.17,18 Furthermore, parents perceive children’s overall experiences to be highly influenced by both the coach17–29 and by their children’s teammates.30,31 Interestingly, though, Game Time Support, defined by determinants such as parent(s) watching your games, people cheering, and being congratulated by parents for playing well, was ranked third by parents and only ninth overall by all players, or more precisely, ninth by older players and sixth by younger players. Plausibly, parents’ responses may have been influenced by a cognitive bias, known as illusory superiority,32,33 which resulted in the overvaluation of the fun-determinants germane to their role.From registering their children to play each season, coordinating sport-related travel, to providing uniforms and equipment to informational and emotional support, the financial resources, time, and volunteer labor necessitated of parents is considerable.34,35 Given the level of dedicated commitment to their children’s sport participation, it is not entirely unexpected that parents would place relatively high importance on their own role in the quality of their children’s sport experience, particularly that which is positive (i.e. fun). In fact, parents are often viewed as architects of their children’s success,36 and therefore, the more they perceive they are a contributing factor to their children’s success, in this case fun, the more moral worth and superiority they may feel.37 Interestingly, though, the results of this study did not indicate that parents overestimated the importance of the fun-determinant winning, when compared to players. This finding was surprising given that parents have been identified in the literature as a source of performance pressure for children38–40 and to emphasize winning;41–44 although, the extent to which this perception exists could possibly be attributable more to anecdotal, popular media coverage45–48 than it has yet to be substantiated in the literature.49–51 The findings of this study may indicate that parents recognize, on the whole, that there is much more to their children’s fun, positive sport experiences than merely the outcome of a game (winning); or, perchance parents responded in a socially desirable way by minimizing the importance of winning.Lower congruence among coaches and playersOf note, the high congruence observed among younger players and their coaches, along with the lower congruence among adolescent players and coaches, is consistent with and support what are known about fun and its relationship to youth sport participants’ retention and attrition. It is well established that youth sport dropout rates accelerate as children age. In fact, fun is the primary determinant of why children continue to play, and its absence, comparatively, is also the main reason children give for dropping out.52–54 Presumably then, young athletes experience more fun at earlier ages and less fun at older ages. The findings of this study, however, are unique in that they are the first to identify precise factors and thus determinants for which discordance between players and coaches exist with regard to fun.The coaches of younger players, for example, generally mirrored the prioritization of the youth athletes’ fun ethos within one or two rankings of each of the fun-factors, except for Team Friendships (e.g. being around friends, hanging with teammates outside of practice or games, and goofing around with teammates), ranked fourth among coaches and eighth among younger players. Similar rank-order disparity was also observed among coaches and older players. Specifically, Team Friendships was ranked second by coaches and sixth by older players. Interestingly, coaches’ perceptions of the importance of Team Friendships, which they rated above Positive Team Dynamics (e.g. playing well together, supporting teammates, showing good sportsmanship), place more importance on “who” their players are engaged with (on and off the field), rather than “what” their players are doing (on the field). For the players in this study, determinants of Positive Team Dynamics among their teammates are essential, primary components of having fun on the practice and game fields and are conceivably foundational to building toward Team Friendships.However, adults’ schema for what constitutes fun is likely more intuitively and strongly associated with the determinants of Team Friendships more than it is to Positive Team Dynamics, defined by performance-related, cooperative, and supportive behavioral-determinants among teammates on the field.7 These types of illusory correlations between two things can lead to predictable biases;55 in this case, a stronger bond perceived between fun and Team Friendships, and to a lesser extent, fun and Positive Team Dynamics. For instance, in adult discussions of children’s sport needs, it is very common for “fun” and “being around friends” to be paired together. In this way, the associative bond between fun and friends becomes stronger through colloquial conversations, though Team Friendships is but one of 11 fun-factors, of which Positive Team Dynamics ranks among the most important. In fact, both younger and older players’ perceptions of more task-oriented fun-factors, such as Trying Hard, Positive Coaching, and Learning and Improving ranked above Team Friendships. That said, the findings of this study do not suggest that Team Friendships are not important to having fun; in fact, they are. However, players’ fun priorities are understood more wholly, relative to one another, when examined in the full context of the FUN MAPS 11 fun-factors and 81 fun-determinants.Trying Hard (ranked sixth by coaches and first by players), Mental Bonuses (e.g. a positive attitude, winning, stress-relief, ignoring the score; ranked ninth by coaches and fifth by players), and Game Time Support (ranked third by coaches and ninth by players) were also factors in which rank-order disparity was observed between coaches and older players. These findings offer insight into the fun-factors and thus determinants clearly holding greater or lesser value for players than may be realized by coaches. This is significant because coaches’ efforts to make fun a focal point will, of course, be influenced by their personal beliefs and perceptions.56 Resolving perceptual disparities between coaches and players will be key to cultivating a culture of fun that meets players’ fun needs within their sport experiences. Transformative learning theory offers youth sport educators (i.e. coaching education directors, sport psychology scientists and practitioners, league administrators, and so on) a framework for the perspective transformation of coaches, and parents too, through active, engaged learning of the fun integration theory’s FUN MAPS and its application in sport settings.Transforming the fun cultureTransformative learning theory is a higher level approach to adult learning that positions educators as cultural architects57,58 with the charge of leading positive reform among key stakeholders. Simply described, transformative learning theory proposes a process of perspective transformation. People’s current assumptions are challenged, and through phases of constructive discourse and communication with others, an openness of perspective evolves within them, and the capacity to transform their perspective begins, which eventually leads them to make meaningful, intentional behavioral changes.59Transformative learning theory would suggest that when coaches are faced with a drastically different approach toward coaching (a disorienting dilemma), they would either reject it completely or begin to open their frame of reference to potentially make sense of it.24 Youth sport educators can facilitate the transformation of soccer coaches’ perspective of fun, first by promoting critical reflection of the coaches own early athletic experiences having fun playing sports, and then paralleling those with the 81 fun-determinants and 11 fun-factors, in addition to challenging false assumptions of fun (e.g. see Ref. 7 and 12 for further review of fun fallacies). This would then help guide coaches in their development of a new schema for fun that is synonymous with what is currently known about soccer players’ requisite fun needs (i.e. the athletes’ fun ethos). In this way, the coaches’ expertise60 is expanded, having acquired knowledge of the full range of fun-promoting actions and behaviors, in the context of skill development and competitive play in youth sport. Also, connecting coaches with other coaches, as mentors, that have successfully transformed their own perspectives of fun, and thus altered their coaching practices, can be significant in leveraging positive role models who have answered the call for coaches to “…privilege young people’s voices in the formation, operation, and adaptation of games, sports, and activities.” (p. 202)24 Furthermore, helping coaches and parents identify ways to implement the many determinants of fun can be profoundly advantageous in bridging the science of what is currently known about fun with intentional, deliberate practice meant to maximize player outcomes. Creating opportunities to observe coaches on the field and provide them with constructive feedback and encouragement to promote their fun-efficacy will also advance coaches’ transformational growth and success in delivering humanistic, athlete-centered programs that are fun and consistent with “…engineering a youth sport structure that focuses on the elements of sport that children value.” (p. 11)3 Effective coaches will be those who are able to successfully apply their knowledge of fun, in specific sport settings, to maximize player outcomes; and, those who are able to demonstrate such coaching effectiveness, over time, can be considered expert (fun) coaches.60 ConclusionDesigning play and practice activities that are fun for athletes is one of the 10 recommended evidence-based youth sport policies.3 Our use of illustrative pattern-match displays and go-zone displays is an innovative methodological approach to comparing the voices of soccer players about that which is chiefly responsible for their continued participation to those of the adults who are responsible for constructing their experiences. It stands to reason that if coaches, who are ultimately responsible for the delivery of sport programs43,61 intentionally provide programming that are overall more congruent with their players’ fun needs, and parents commit to facilitating fun for their child(ren) on the field via Game Time Support,55,62 along with supportive experiences away from the field, such as constructive, encouraging post-game talk on the car ride home,63 players will have healthier, more positive experiences, and will thusly be more likely to continue to stay active and involved in sports.64 The results of this study further our knowledge of specific fun-factors within youth soccer on which divergence of perceptions is most evident in adolescence that, in effect, deepens our understanding of fun-determinants on which adults, who exert considerable influence on youth’s experiences,43,65 can better meet players’ fun needs.Notwithstanding these findings, the overall high congruence observed between parents and players, and also between coaches and younger players, is very encouraging; and, although the degree of congruence between coaches and older players was the lowest, at the most discrete level, only 18 of the 81 fun-determinants were significantly different. Meaning, 77.78% of the determinant comparisons between coaches and older players were similar. Overall, it is worth spotlighting that there were generally more similarities in the perceived importance of the fun-factors and determinants across the player, parent, and coach comparisons than differences. Thus, the findings of this study would suggest that parents’ and coaches’ relative understanding of children’s fun priorities are worth applauding. However, the extent to which their cognitive understanding translates to overt, actionable behaviors that promote fun on the field remains to be studied, as declining participation trends in team sports66 would suggest that one aspect to retaining children’s participation in health-promoting sport activities is higher quality, more fun experiences.Limitations and future directionsThis study was possible given its secondary analysis approach to the data provided by the youth soccer players, parents, and coaches whose individual contributions to the original concept mapping study collectively conceptualized the determinants and factors composing the FUN MAPS. Thus, an inherent limitation is that its findings are entirely circumscribed to youth soccer participants from a mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Furthermore, the parent (largely female) and coach (largely male) samples within this study, though representative of those sexes that tend to be more likely to voluntarily participate in research studies67–69 and hold coaching roles,70 may have impacted the study findings, leading to a greater degree of congruence observed among the comparison groups. Unfortunately, given the relatively small sample of parents and coaches in this study, we were underpowered to conduct sex comparisons, respectively.To test this study’s findings, with larger samples, in other team-based sports (beyond soccer), across diverse regions of the United States, and internationally across the globe, using concept and mapping methods would be incredibly resource-heavy and time-intensive. Fortunately, the maps generated from concept and mapping studies naturally lend to the development of a measurement tool(s).71 Essentially, the determinants and factors from the FUN MAPS become the tool’s items and scales. Opportunely, the 81 fun-determinants that were originally brainstormed and became the basis of the FUN MAPS were done so in a manner intended to be representative of youth’s experience across numerous team-based sports.10 This would, therefore, be of great advantage with respect to validity when developing, refining, and testing a fun tool across sports. A tool such as this, after proving to be psychometrically sound, quick to administer and complete, and easily used in field settings, would be an important and needed advancement in this area of research, particularly in the evaluation and monitoring of the quality of youth’s sport experiences. In addition to a self-report player tool, the development of tools measuring coaches’ perceptions of their team’s fun experiences, and parents’ perceptions of their children’s experiences, would be an important advancement in the triangulation of the chief determinant responsible for children’s continued participation in sport—that is, fun. Furthermore, the value of the fun integration theory’s FUN MAPS, as an applied framework for youth sport programs and player outcomes (i.e. enhanced performance, personal development, and sustained participation), must be tested using carefully designed, rigorous, randomized controlled trials of intervention that will require precise measures of fun that are valid and reliable.Lastly, future research may consider concept mapping what is fun for coaches with respect to coaching and what constitutes a generally positive experience as a coach involved in organized youth sports. After all, in addition to players, coaches are key stakeholders in the youth sport landscape and players, whether recreational or competitive, are dependent on coaches for their athletic development. Perhaps a coach’s FUN MAP, particularly for volunteer coaches, would be helpful in providing direction and insight into their experiences that could assist leagues and clubs in enhancing a coach’s experience, thereby keeping these coaches engaged in their programs. Indeed, of great value to the fun integration theory’s FUN MAPS, and any other map conceptualized through future research, is the stakeholder-derived manner in which the maps are developed and their capacity to turn science into action.",introductionyouth sport program recommend child-cent physic activities 1 2 yet   adult-driven   day-to-day oper organ athlet   child voic rare central deliveri

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/25467949/,"IntroductionThe first fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been produced over 25 years ago by two parallel technologies: phage display, with selection of antigen-specific binders from blood lymphocyte libraries, and transgenic mice, with integrated human immunoglobulin (Ig) loci (Bruggemann et al. 1989a; Bruggemann and Neuberger 1996; McCafferty et al. 1990; Neuberger and Bruggemann 1997). In the transgenic approach, natural diversification and selection are being exploited as integrated loci are under the control of the animal’s immune system where they can undergo normal processes of DNA rearrangement and hypermutation. Interestingly, human or mouse, and probably all mammalian Ig loci work in very similar ways, which was confirmed in early experiments using a germline-configured chimeric construct (Bruggemann et al. 1989a).A challenge to the transgenic antibody technology was the large size of the human Ig loci (Cook and Tomlinson 1995; Frippiat et al. 1995; Matsuda et al. 1993; Pallares et al. 1999; Weichhold et al. 1993). Emphasis was on inclusion of V genes, as many and as diverse as possible, rather than, for example, all D segments or several C genes for the H chain (reviewed in Bruggemann et al. 2007). Early approaches used minigenes and even with a small number of genes mAbs with good binding characteristics could be obtained (Green et al. 1994; Taylor et al. 1994; Wagner et al. 1994). Improvements in oocytes microinjection and the use of embryonic stem (ES) cells permitted the integration of larger regions; first on plasmids and cosmids (Bruggemann et al. 1991; Taylor et al. 1994), and then on bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) and yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) (Davies et al. 1993; Mendez et al. 1997; Nicholson et al. 1999; Popov et al. 1999; Wagner et al. 1996).At the same time, various Ig knock-out (KO) lines were derived, with µMT being the earliest mouse line with a silenced IgH locus (Kitamura et al. 1991). Apart from studying lymphocyte development and antibody expression in mice without fully functional H- and/or L-chain loci, these approaches aided human antibody expression from introduced transgenic Ig loci significantly. Many silencing strategies were successful: removal of the JH segments, abolished DNA rearrangement (Chen et al. 1993a), deleting all CH genes eliminated H chain expression and trans-switching (Ren et al. 2004), the various Cκ or Jκ KOs and a Cλ KO silenced IgL expression (Chen et al. 1993b; Sanchez et al. 1994; Zou et al. 2003). Breeding regimes to combine H- and L-chain KOs with human IgH and IgL transloci produced multi-feature animals expressing considerable levels of diverse fully human Ig.The production of transgenic antibody repertoires, similar or comparable to those in humans, requires diverse rearrangement combined with high expression of human V, (D) and J segments, ideally from a large gene pool. This has been achieved only recently in rodent lines, not with fully human constructs but chimeric Ig loci, where immune responses similar to wild-type (WT) animals and diversity comparable to recorded human antibody sequences were found (Lee et al. 2014; Ma et al. 2013; Osborn et al. 2013). In Fig. 1a, the human IgH locus with all VHs, Ds and JH genes/segments is illustrated. Features of the various fully human and chimeric IgH transloci, large and small, are presented in Fig. 1b. Open in a separate windowFig. 1Human IgH loci. a The complete VH, D and JH region from the most 5′ VH, IgHV3–74, to the most 3′ JH segment, JH6, is accommodated on ~950 kb (Lefranc and Lefranc 2001). b Transgenic constructs and features. Animals were derived from manipulated fibroblasts (cattle) or ES cells (mouse) and by DNA microinjection (mouse and rat). In several lines, human Ig expression appeared to be reduced. Endogenous VDJ use or H chain products with non-human segments, such as mouse or cattle Vs, were obtained in strains with leaky or incomplete endogenous KO Fully Human Ig TranslociFully human transloci contain exclusively human V, (D), J and C genes, while in chimeric human transloci human V, (D) and J genes or regions have been linked to host (rat, mouse or cattle) C genes. In many cases, the size of the fully human Ig constructs assembled, for example, in plasmids, cosmids or phages, limited the number of genes that could be included as these vectors could only accommodate regions below ~100 kb. This meant that V genes had to be gathered in close proximity, D and J segments were tightly linked and C genes had to be carefully chosen. The result was poor expression from such mini-gene constructs although several useful human antibodies have been derived (Lonberg et al. 1994). The assembly of larger constructs in YACs by homologous overlaps (Davies and Bruggemann 1993; Davies et al. 1992; Popov et al. 1996), and subsequent introduction of YACs into ES cells by spheroplast fusion or lipofection enabled the integration of several hundred kb up to ~1 Mb large human IgH and IgL regions into the mouse genome (Choi et al. 1993; Davies et al. 1993; Mendez et al. 1997; Nicholson et al. 1999; Popov et al. 1999). Introduction of human mini-chromosomes by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer established ES cell-derived mouse lines producing fully human mAbs (Kuroiwa et al. 2002; Tomizuka et al. 2000) and cattle, derived from manipulated fibroblasts, which expressed considerable amounts of human polyclonal Ig (Matsushita et al. 2014; Sano et al. 2013). However, the production of fully human mAbs in transchromosomic mice appeared to be less than 1 % (Tomizuka et al. 2000) and only about 50 % of fully human IgG was identified in transchromosomic cattle, often at quite reduced levels (Matsushita et al. 2014). Although problems concerned with trans-chromosome truncation, chimerism and transmission stability have been addressed, these could not be fully resolved (Kakeda et al. 2005). A solution, which considerably improved expression and efficiency of hybridoma production, was cross-breeding of IgH trans-chromo mice with Igκ XenoMouse (Ishida et al. 2002; Mendez et al. 1997).Despite the improvement and breeding with endogenous KO lines, human antibody titers were still suboptimal or at best variable and despite diverse V, D and J usage, class-switching was frequently poor and hypermutation was relatively low (Bruggemann et al. 2007). A problem for many academic researchers was that supposedly superior transgenic animals, produced by companies, were not generally available and little support was provided to improve available lines or constructs once they had been published or shown to work in principle. Nevertheless, useful fully human IgM antibodies of reasonable affinity against HIV (when converted to human IgG1) could be retrieved even from lines carrying few V genes and lacking class-switching (Pruzina et al. 2011).Rearrangement and expression of human IgL loci was achieved with mini-gene constructs assembled on plasmids and also larger regions on BACs and YACs; these earlier constructs have been extensively reviewed (Bruggemann et al. 2007, 2014). A comparison of human Igκ L-chain transloci showed that various germline-configured regions, from 15 kb to over 1 Mb, readily express serum Ig but that larger regions, with naturally spaced genes, produce much higher antibody yields (Xian et al. 1998). Several larger fully human IgL loci were highly expressed even in a WT background, which showed successful competition with the endogenous L-chain loci. For example, an authentic 380 kb human Igλ YAC with 15 functional Vλ genes produced high antibody titers from diverse and hypermutated transcripts (Nicholson et al. 1999; Osborn et al. 2013; Popov et al. 1999). Thus, it can be concluded that large fully human L-chain constructs can be expressed similar to WT L-chain levels in transgenic animals (Ma et al. 2013; Osborn et al. 2013). Chimeric Human Ig TranslociTo ensure optimal physiological interaction of translocus-encoded membrane Ig with endogenous components of antigen-receptor associated polypeptides, it has been speculated and later shown that chimeric constructs with human VDJ linked to rodent CH are most efficient (Green 2014; Ma et al. 2013; Osborn et al. 2013; Pruzina et al. 2011). Strategies to link human IgH V genes, D and J segments with mouse or rat CH genes made use of BAC and YAC technology for (1) sub-cloning and joining large regions to secure overlapping integration by DNA microinjection into oocytes (Ma et al. 2013; Osborn et al. 2013) and (2) sequential site-specific integration of BACs with human V and V-D-J regions upstream of mouse Cµ by gene targeting or recombinase-mediated exchange (Lee et al. 2014; Murphy 2009). Human VHs are efficiently rearranged in transgenic mammals and their linkage to endogenous CH genes provides a flawless interplay with the cellular signaling machinery. Combined interactions of the many components that aid B cell receptor (BCR) signaling (see: http://www.biocarta.com/genes/PathwayGeneSearch.asp) secure efficient B cell activation with normal immune responses. Endogenous CH genes will also allow optimal physiological interactions necessary in the regulation of immune responses by the various host Fc receptors (Nimmerjahn and Ravetch 2007; Rowland et al. 2013).Conventional transgenic technologies with DNA microinjection into oocytes enable the integration of multiple BACs and large YACs. This allowed the insertion of three linear and overlapping BAC regions with homologous end sequences 5′ and 3′, which provided about half of all human V genes, all D and all J segments (Osborn et al. 2013). A comparison of independent founders carrying a continuous region of over 500 kb randomly integrated found high expression levels independent of the site of integration. The conclusion derived from many chimeric (human V D J, rat C) IgH, as well as fully human Igκ and Igλ lines, is that antibodies obtained from multiple large integrations at one position can be as efficiently expressed as WT Ig if the constructs contain the necessary regulatory sequences (Ma et al. 2013). Furthermore, multiple integration of microinjected DNA, i.e., several copies of the same BAC or YAC, may well be advantageous as larger gene pools with an increased number of available genes could facilitate more extensive receptor editing (Liu et al. 2013; Nemazee and Weigert 2000; Ouled-Haddou et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2003).Considerable efforts have been made to integrate large numbers and possibly all human VH, D and JH segments upstream of mouse Cµ (Green 2014; Lee et al. 2014; Murphy 2009; Murphy et al. 2014). Lee et al. (2014) showed that with site-specifically integrated WT and mutated loxP sites, it was possible to provide a BAC landing pad for adding human V-regions upstream of the first endogenous C gene. This approach employed sequential integration of modified BACs, which reconstituted or replaced the mouse VH-region with equivalent human genes. The result was to reconstitute a near authentic human VH-D-JH as well as Vκ-Jκ and Vλ-Jλ region (Green 2014; Lee et al. 2014; Murphy 2009). With these insertions, duplications or multimeric integration of the same BAC are barred, which ensures a genuine V gene order and content. However, there has been no indication that non-selected or random integration of large transloci was disadvantageous and choosing particular founders (or combination of founders for IgH and IgL) secured high expression and breeding to homozygosity.Integration of human L-chain V-J regions adjacent to the mouse CL gene has also been shown to yield extensive chimeric antibody repertoires, but reports explained that endogenous L-chain rearrangements were not entirely prohibited (Green 2014; Lee et al. 2014). In contrast, randomly integrated fully human Igκ or Igλ transloci could be cleanly expressed—without residual rodent Ig in KO lines—and extensive levels and diversity similar to WT have been obtained (Osborn et al. 2013). This means that there are no apparent advantages employing locus replacement strategies in this instance. Ig KO StrainsIg loci have been knocked out or disabled in mouse, rat and cattle (Bruggemann et al. 2007; Matsushita et al. 2014; Osborn et al. 2013; Tomizuka et al. 2000). Strategies involved gene targeting in ES cells via insertion or deletion using, for example, Cre/loxP which allowed the removal of >100 kb regions (Ren et al. 2004; Zou et al. 2003). Recently, the use of zinc-finger (endo)nuclease (ZFN) constructs for DNA microinjections into oocytes produced several IgH and IgL KO lines in the rat (Geurts et al. 2009; Menoret et al. 2010; Osborn et al. 2013) and silenced the IgH locus in rabbits (Flisikowska et al. 2011). Advantages of the ZFN technology are that non-homologous end joining to silence a gene or locus via deletions up to several kb can also provide a target site for homologous integration (Cui et al. 2011).More recently combined gene targeting and locus extension have been taken to the next level. In one approach where Cre recombinase was directed to opposite loxP sites, integration was followed by inversion of the mouse VH-D-JH region and, separately, Vκ-Jκ region (Lee et al. 2014). This would not necessarily prevent DNA rearrangement but with sufficient separation from C genes splicing resulting in V(D)J-C products appeared to be minimal (Lee et al. 2014). In another approach, deletion of the whole V-region from both mouse IgH and Igκ loci was obtained (Green 2014).A considerable advantage in expressing a human antibody repertoire in transgenic animals is the lack of all endogenous Ig as this greatly simplifies the production of polyclonal Ig, as shown in cattle (Matsushita et al. 2014), and monoclonal Ig in rats (Osborn et al. 2013) and mice (see: http://www.crescendobiologics.com/rnd/crescendo-mouse). In these animals, no IgH, Igκ and Igλ with endogenous V(D)J is being produced. The absence of endogenous Ig prevents a bias in the immune response, for example, selecting more compatible mouse idiotypes, and means that selection and purification can be avoided. ApplicationsmAb therapy has been developed to provide reagents that specifically bind to cellular receptors or interact with circulating targets for their removal or neutralization. Target cell depletion can be achieved by Fc receptor interaction and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity has been identified as an important mechanism to eliminate tumor cells (Hjelm et al. 2006; Kim and Ashkenazi 2013; Mellor et al. 2013). Binding of mAbs to particular cell-surface receptors via the variable domain and simultaneously engaging with natural killer cells, monocytes or macrophages via Fc receptor interaction provided by the constant region (C region) initiates a cascade of events important for removal or reduction of abnormal or malignant cells and pathogens. In many epithelial tumors, epidermal growth factor receptor is expressed at high levels and the tumor cell load of many patients could be reduced with Vectibix (see: http://www.vectibix.com). Tumor inhibition was also achieved with anti-CD20 mAbs, which were effective in initiating the destruction or killing of B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, another very aggressive disease (Zhang 2009).Important validation for using transgenic lines includes how well they compare with WT animals with respect to serum titer, diversity and B cell development and if they can be bred to homozygosity, which was achieved with various rat and mouse strains. Success in DNA rearrangement and antibody expression of the first construct assembled in germline configuration (Bruggemann et al. 1989a) was followed by important progress regarding gene targeting, to knock-out the mouse Ig loci, and genetic engineering, to assemble large regions on artificial chromosomes such as YACs (reviewed in Bruggemann 2001). These advances were crucial to obtain specific, fully human antibodies from the introduced human IgH (mini)loci expressed in mice in the 1990s (Fishwild et al. 1996; Lonberg et al. 1994; Mendez et al. 1997). However, none of these early strains could match WT animals with regard to B cell numbers, antibody titers, diversity and hypermutation (Bruggemann et al. 2014; Green and Jakobovits 1998). Nevertheless, despite reduced expression levels, antibodies from these early transgenic animals, in clinical trials and on the market, have been obtained using hybridoma technology (Green 2014). To overcome the limitations of these first-generation strains, new transgenic animals have been designed (Lee et al. 2014; Ma et al. 2013; Osborn et al. 2013).FDA approved and marketed fully human mAbs produced from the early mouse strains are listed in Table 1. The success of these mouse lines accelerated the shift from using murine and chimeric antibodies to fully human antibodies (reviewed in Bruggemann et al. 2014). Initially, conventional immunization regimes and myeloma fusion with spleen cells were adopted from procedures using WT mice or rats (Kohler and Milstein 1975; Lachmann et al. 1980). However, in recently derived strains, mAb production was significantly increased by the optimization of immunization protocols. For example, fusions of mouse myeloma cells with rat iliac lymph node cells collected after rapid immunization schemes and, separately, spleen cells obtained after multiple or booster immunizations, frequently resulted in many thousand hybridomas from one animal with sometimes over 100 diverse and high-affinity IgGs (Osborn et al. 2013).

Close to 500 mAbs have been reported to be in active clinical development during the past 3 years, including ~25 % in phase I, ~40 % in phase II, ~20 % in phase III and ~15 % at approval stage (BioPharm Insight database). A large majority, ~60 %, are indicated primarily for treatment of cancer, e.g., reduction of solid tumors possibly by blocking growth or inducing apoptosis. Other therapeutic categories include immunological (10 %), musculoskeletal (7 %) and infectious diseases (4 %). Therapeutic antibodies are also being developed for respiratory, dermatologic, central nervous system, hematologic, eye/ear, cardiovascular, HIV, liver and other diseases. Clinical-stage antibodies derived from transgenic animals are shown in Table 2. Four distinct mouse lines have been used to generate these: HuMAb antibody or UltiMAb antibody Mouse (Lonberg et al. 1994), XenoMouse (Mendez et al. 1997), TransChromo Mouse (Ishida et al. 2002) and VelocImmune Mouse (Murphy et al. 2014).

(1994)Open in a separate windowDifferent transgenic species are vitally important in providing human antibodies because of the trans-species gene similarities. Thus, sequence comparison of rat, mouse and human demonstrates that some genes are strikingly similar and that the less similar animal provides the better immune response. The other advantage of using different transgenic species (e.g. rats and mice) is that their transgene usage varies. As a result, many more genes from different families yield antibodies of high affinity for the same antigen, which may prove valuable for future immune therapy with mAb mixtures. For example, high-affinity human antibodies have recently been obtained from several other rodent lines; OmniRat (Ma et al. 2013; Osborn et al. 2013) and OmniMouse (http://www.omtinc.net), Kymouse (Lee et al. 2014) and Harbour Mouse (http://harbourantibodies.com/science-technology/h2l2/#.UyxGntzVvwI). Rabbits have also been used to produce human antibodies (Flisikowska et al. 2011). Novel antibodies with a common light chain have been obtained from the MeMo mouse (http://www.merus.nl/technology/memo.html) and OmniFlic (http://www.openmonoclonaltechnology.com/antibody_technology.html) lines. For therapeutic applications and minimizing immunogenicity, endogenous C regions can be easily replaced by the desired isotype without compromising antigen specificity (Bruggemann et al. 1989b; Presta 2006). ConclusionsHuman antibodies produced in transgenic animals represent an important, broad and rapidly growing therapeutic class with a predicted global market reaching many billion US dollars (http://www.marketresearch.com). The success is based on a now proven technology with DNA insertion of Ig loci into the germline followed by expression of human antibody repertoires. Transgenic animals are increasingly used to produce antibodies with fully human idiotypes, a trend that is expected to continue in years to come as described in reports by The Times and BBC news (both June 3, 2014) as “trials show they are fulfilling their promise fast”.Significant improvements have been made recently with the derivation of transgenic rat and mouse lines that, after immunization, readily produce diverse high-affinity antibodies as efficiently as WT animals (Osborn et al. 2013). World-leading biopharmaceutical companies are now using these animals to generate future human therapeutic antibodies for a wide range of conditions.",introductionth first fulli human monoclon

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/30525092/,"Reprogramming of mRNA translation has recently emerged as a central mechanism driving the adaptation of tumor cells during cancer progression and response to therapy.1 mRNA translation is based on the pairing between codons of mRNAs and anticodons of tRNAs. Modifications of tRNA molecules in the anticodon, and particularly at the wobble position, directly impact their decoding capacity and affect translation elongation.2 We previously showed that enzymes modifying the tRNA wobble uridine (U34-enzymes) are essential during WNT-driven intestinal cancer initiation,3 they promote breast cancer metastasis,4 but they are dispensable for normal intestinal and breast tissue maintenance.3-5 In the current study,6 we explored whether wobble uridine tRNA modification contributes to specific mRNA translation rewiring during oncogene-induced transformation and/or adaptation of cancer cells to therapy.Malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive form of skin cancer whose incidence is rising worldwide and with poor prognosis when not restricted by surgical exportation. Genomics studies of human melanoma have shown that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is often deregulated in melanoma, with nearly 50% of the patients harbouring a single activating mutation of the BRAF gene, with V600E being the most common mutation (BRAFV600E). Specific inhibitors of the oncoprotein BRAFV600E have been used in the clinic and despite dramatic anti-tumor responses observed in the first weeks, insurgence of resistance deeply limits their efficacy.7 Among the various resistance mechanisms already described, metabolic reprogramming towards glycolysis has been shown to promote resistance towards BRAF inhibitors in melanoma patients.8In our recent study,6 we found that U34-enzymes are largely increased in human melanoma biopsies and primary melanoma lines compared to healthy melanocytes. Genetic deletion of elp3 (Elongator complex protein 3), one of the key U34-enzyme, strongly impaired melanoma insurgence in zebrafish with a BRAFV600E/p53−/- background. Moreover, depletion of the U34-enzymes ELP3 or CTU1/2 (Cytoplasmic tRNA 2-thiolation protein 1 and 2) induced cell death in patient-derived BRAFV600E melanoma cultures. By combining comparative proteomics and metabolomics approaches, we demonstrated that highly glycolytic melanoma cultures are dependent on U34-enzymes for survival. Specifically, we showed that the mRNA translation of the transcription factor Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α), a key regulator of glycolysis in the cells, is supported by the U34-enzymes. In fact, depletion of U34-enzymes resulted in decreased amount of HIF1α protein levels due to abnormal accumulation of the ribosomes and defective translation elongation at the HIF1α transcript. Strikingly, we found that this effect is codon-specific, as a systematic replacement of the U34-sensitive codons (namely AAA, GAA and CAA) in HIF1α mRNA into their insensitive synonymous counterpart (respectively AAG, GAG and CAG), abolished the need of U34-enzymes during HIF1α translation: it normalized ribosome distribution along HIF1α transcript and it restored HIF1α protein expression upon depletion of U34-enzymes. This indicates that U34-enzymes regulate HIF1α translation in a codon-specific manner (Figure 1).Open in a separate windowFigure 1.Mechanisms linking U34-enzymes to melanoma cell survival and resistance to targeted therapy. Wobble uridine tRNA modifying enzymes (U34-enzymes) are upregulated in malignant melanoma following activation of the Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase (PI3K) signalling pathway through a direct, mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2)-dependent mechanism. U34-enzymes promote mRNA translation of Hypoxia-induced factor 1-alpha (HIF1α) in a codon-dependent manner to sustain high levels of HIF1α and maintain a glycolytic metabolism, which confers resistance toward MAPK-based therapy.Previous studies have associated HIF1α expression and glycolytic switch to insurgence of resistance towards MAPK-based targeted therapies in melanoma.9 We found that resistant and metastatic malignant melanoma have higher levels of the U34-enzymes and of HIF1α. Strikingly, when we depleted the U34-enzymes in both in vitro and in vivo models of resistant melanoma, tumors were resensitized to targeted therapy. Moreover, this effect is, at least in part, due to HIF1α mistranslation. These results indicate that U34-enzymes promote resistance towards targeted therapy, at least by promoting codon-specific HIF1α mRNA translation. Resistance in melanoma is often mediated by activation of the Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase (PI3K) pathway.7 In our study, we highlighted that the PI3K-mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2) axis directly regulates the U34-enzymes through phosphorylation and stabilization of the scaffold Elongator protein 1 (ELP1), suggesting that the levels of U34-enzymes are dynamically regulated in time by the oncogenic PI3K-mTORC2 pathway,6 (Figure 1).The efficacy of targeted therapies in melanoma is strongly limited by the insurgence of resistance, which causes relapses. In our study, we uncovered a novel resistance mechanism through upregulation of wobble uridine tRNA modification and codon-specific reprogramming of mRNA translation. We highlighted a new family of enzymes that is essential to promote adaptation to therapy and acquisition of resistance by regulation of selective mRNA translation.6 These data are highly significant for the patients because they suggest that targeting the U34-enzymes in combination with MAPK-based therapies might become a new therapeutic option to prolong treatment efficacy and to prevent tumor relapse.Further questions remain. First, although we have shown that HIF1α, whose mRNA is enriched in U34-codons, relies on U34-enzymes for its expression, it is still unclear how ribosome pausing at specific codons in mRNAs affects subsequent protein expression. One possible explanation is that a slow-down during translation elongation, as seen upon U34-enzymes depletion, affects co-translational protein folding. This is supported by our data showing that the newly synthetized HIF1α is directed to the protein aggregates upon depletion of U34-enzymes. Being able to predict the proteome that relies on U34-enzymes for correct expression is essential to identify the pathological contexts where the U34-enzymes play key roles. Second, we demonstrated that the PI3K-mTORC2 signalling pathway regulates the levels of the U34-enzymatic complex Elongator. Understanding the precise mechanisms underlying this regulation merits further investigation. In which cellular compartment does this happen? What other pathway(s) could be involved? How does this regulation translate into U34-tRNA modifications and how does it impact on mRNA translation and the establishment of a specific proteome? Investigating how U34-enzymes are regulated is crucial to predict their real impact in normal physiology and in pathophysiological conditions.Modifications of tRNAs and their role in the regulation of specific translational reprogramming is a new and exciting field which has rapidly expanded in the last years.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/30525092/,"Reprogramming of mRNA translation has recently emerged as a central mechanism driving the adaptation of tumor cells during cancer progression and response to therapy.1 mRNA translation is based on the pairing between codons of mRNAs and anticodons of tRNAs. Modifications of tRNA molecules in the anticodon, and particularly at the wobble position, directly impact their decoding capacity and affect translation elongation.2 We previously showed that enzymes modifying the tRNA wobble uridine (U34-enzymes) are essential during WNT-driven intestinal cancer initiation,3 they promote breast cancer metastasis,4 but they are dispensable for normal intestinal and breast tissue maintenance.3-5 In the current study,6 we explored whether wobble uridine tRNA modification contributes to specific mRNA translation rewiring during oncogene-induced transformation and/or adaptation of cancer cells to therapy.Malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive form of skin cancer whose incidence is rising worldwide and with poor prognosis when not restricted by surgical exportation. Genomics studies of human melanoma have shown that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is often deregulated in melanoma, with nearly 50% of the patients harbouring a single activating mutation of the BRAF gene, with V600E being the most common mutation (BRAFV600E). Specific inhibitors of the oncoprotein BRAFV600E have been used in the clinic and despite dramatic anti-tumor responses observed in the first weeks, insurgence of resistance deeply limits their efficacy.7 Among the various resistance mechanisms already described, metabolic reprogramming towards glycolysis has been shown to promote resistance towards BRAF inhibitors in melanoma patients.8In our recent study,6 we found that U34-enzymes are largely increased in human melanoma biopsies and primary melanoma lines compared to healthy melanocytes. Genetic deletion of elp3 (Elongator complex protein 3), one of the key U34-enzyme, strongly impaired melanoma insurgence in zebrafish with a BRAFV600E/p53−/- background. Moreover, depletion of the U34-enzymes ELP3 or CTU1/2 (Cytoplasmic tRNA 2-thiolation protein 1 and 2) induced cell death in patient-derived BRAFV600E melanoma cultures. By combining comparative proteomics and metabolomics approaches, we demonstrated that highly glycolytic melanoma cultures are dependent on U34-enzymes for survival. Specifically, we showed that the mRNA translation of the transcription factor Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α), a key regulator of glycolysis in the cells, is supported by the U34-enzymes. In fact, depletion of U34-enzymes resulted in decreased amount of HIF1α protein levels due to abnormal accumulation of the ribosomes and defective translation elongation at the HIF1α transcript. Strikingly, we found that this effect is codon-specific, as a systematic replacement of the U34-sensitive codons (namely AAA, GAA and CAA) in HIF1α mRNA into their insensitive synonymous counterpart (respectively AAG, GAG and CAG), abolished the need of U34-enzymes during HIF1α translation: it normalized ribosome distribution along HIF1α transcript and it restored HIF1α protein expression upon depletion of U34-enzymes. This indicates that U34-enzymes regulate HIF1α translation in a codon-specific manner (Figure 1).Open in a separate windowFigure 1.Mechanisms linking U34-enzymes to melanoma cell survival and resistance to targeted therapy. Wobble uridine tRNA modifying enzymes (U34-enzymes) are upregulated in malignant melanoma following activation of the Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase (PI3K) signalling pathway through a direct, mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2)-dependent mechanism. U34-enzymes promote mRNA translation of Hypoxia-induced factor 1-alpha (HIF1α) in a codon-dependent manner to sustain high levels of HIF1α and maintain a glycolytic metabolism, which confers resistance toward MAPK-based therapy.Previous studies have associated HIF1α expression and glycolytic switch to insurgence of resistance towards MAPK-based targeted therapies in melanoma.9 We found that resistant and metastatic malignant melanoma have higher levels of the U34-enzymes and of HIF1α. Strikingly, when we depleted the U34-enzymes in both in vitro and in vivo models of resistant melanoma, tumors were resensitized to targeted therapy. Moreover, this effect is, at least in part, due to HIF1α mistranslation. These results indicate that U34-enzymes promote resistance towards targeted therapy, at least by promoting codon-specific HIF1α mRNA translation. Resistance in melanoma is often mediated by activation of the Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase (PI3K) pathway.7 In our study, we highlighted that the PI3K-mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2) axis directly regulates the U34-enzymes through phosphorylation and stabilization of the scaffold Elongator protein 1 (ELP1), suggesting that the levels of U34-enzymes are dynamically regulated in time by the oncogenic PI3K-mTORC2 pathway,6 (Figure 1).The efficacy of targeted therapies in melanoma is strongly limited by the insurgence of resistance, which causes relapses. In our study, we uncovered a novel resistance mechanism through upregulation of wobble uridine tRNA modification and codon-specific reprogramming of mRNA translation. We highlighted a new family of enzymes that is essential to promote adaptation to therapy and acquisition of resistance by regulation of selective mRNA translation.6 These data are highly significant for the patients because they suggest that targeting the U34-enzymes in combination with MAPK-based therapies might become a new therapeutic option to prolong treatment efficacy and to prevent tumor relapse.Further questions remain. First, although we have shown that HIF1α, whose mRNA is enriched in U34-codons, relies on U34-enzymes for its expression, it is still unclear how ribosome pausing at specific codons in mRNAs affects subsequent protein expression. One possible explanation is that a slow-down during translation elongation, as seen upon U34-enzymes depletion, affects co-translational protein folding. This is supported by our data showing that the newly synthetized HIF1α is directed to the protein aggregates upon depletion of U34-enzymes. Being able to predict the proteome that relies on U34-enzymes for correct expression is essential to identify the pathological contexts where the U34-enzymes play key roles. Second, we demonstrated that the PI3K-mTORC2 signalling pathway regulates the levels of the U34-enzymatic complex Elongator. Understanding the precise mechanisms underlying this regulation merits further investigation. In which cellular compartment does this happen? What other pathway(s) could be involved? How does this regulation translate into U34-tRNA modifications and how does it impact on mRNA translation and the establishment of a specific proteome? Investigating how U34-enzymes are regulated is crucial to predict their real impact in normal physiology and in pathophysiological conditions.Modifications of tRNAs and their role in the regulation of specific translational reprogramming is a new and exciting field which has rapidly expanded in the last years. Our findings bring a new important piece of evidence demonstrating the role of U34-enzymes in cancer adaptation to therapy by sustaining metabolic rewiring through codon-dependent regulation of HIF1α mRNA translation. Given the importance of HIF1α transcriptional activity in various malignant tumors,10 the targeting the U34-enzymes might prove to be relevant not only for melanoma patients but also in a wide range of cancers.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/32196085/,"AbstractDivergence in gene expression regulation is common between closely related species and may give rise to incompatibilities in their hybrid progeny. In this study, we investigated the relationship between regulatory evolution within species and reproductive isolation between species. We focused on a well-studied case of hybrid sterility between two closely related yellow monkeyflower species, Mimulus guttatus and Mimulus nasutus, that is caused by two epistatic loci, hybrid male sterility 1 (hms1) and hybrid male sterility 2 (hms2). We compared genome-wide transcript abundance across male and female reproductive tissues (i.e., stamens and carpels) from four genotypes: M. guttatus, M. nasutus, and sterile and fertile progeny from an advanced M. nasutus–M. guttatus introgression line carrying the hms1–hms2 incompatibility. We observed substantial variation in transcript abundance between M. guttatus and M. nasutus, including distinct but overlapping patterns of tissue-biased expression, providing evidence for regulatory divergence between these species. We also found rampant genome-wide misexpression, but only in the affected tissues (i.e., stamens) of sterile introgression hybrids carrying incompatible alleles at hms1 and hms2. Examining patterns of allele-specific expression in sterile and fertile introgression hybrids, we found evidence for interspecific divergence in cis- and trans-regulation, including compensatory cis–trans mutations likely to be driven by stabilizing selection. Nevertheless, species divergence in gene regulatory networks cannot explain the vast majority of the gene misexpression we observe in Mimulus introgression hybrids, which instead likely manifests as a downstream consequence of sterility itself.Keywords: monkeyflower, Mimulus, allele-specific expression, regulatory divergence, Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibility, hybrid male sterility IntroductionClosely related species often show considerable regulatory divergence—that is, they have accumulated differences in the cis-acting DNA sequences or trans-acting factors that regulate gene expression (Tautz 2000; Wray et al. 2003). As with any epistatic loci, divergence in interacting regulatory elements might lead to incompatibilities in the hybrid progeny of interspecific crosses (Dobzhansky 1937; Muller 1942; Mack and Nachman 2017). Such hybrid incompatibilities might arise due to independent substitutions in distinct lineages, with genetic drift or selection increasing the frequency of a derived allele at a cis-acting locus in one species and a trans-acting partner locus in the other. In the classic Dobzhansky–Muller model, these derived alleles are neutral or favored on their own but cause aberrant gene expression when combined in hybrids. Alternatively, hybrid incompatibilities might arise because of coevolution between cis- and trans-elements within a single lineage. Stabilizing selection to maintain optimal levels of transcription, which favors cis- and trans-regulatory variants that compensate for each other, appears to be an important force shaping gene expression evolution (Gilad et al. 2006; Tirosh et al. 2009; Goncalves et al. 2012; Coolon et al. 2014; Mack et al. 2016). Thus, even when transcript abundance for a particular gene does not differ between species, the underlying regulatory components controlling its expression might have diverged (Tautz 2000; True and Haag 2001; Wray et al. 2003). This process of compensatory evolution in gene regulatory networks, which is likely to affect different sets of genes in diverging lineages, has been proposed as a major source of hybrid incompatibilities between species (Landry et al. 2005; Takahasi et al. 2011).Despite the clear importance of changes in gene expression for phenotypic evolution (Wittkopp 2013), empirical support for regulatory divergence as a general driver of hybrid incompatibilities is mixed. Although many studies have uncovered pervasive gene misexpression in sterile hybrids (i.e., over- or under-expression in hybrids relative to both parental species: Michalak and Noor 2003; Ranz et al. 2004; Haerty and Singh 2006; Malone et al. 2007; Coolon et al. 2014; Brill et al. 2016; Mack et al. 2016), others have found no association between patterns of gene expression and hybrid dysfunction (Barbash and Lorigan 2007; Wei et al. 2014; Guerrero et al. 2016). Even when sterile or inviable hybrids do show widespread misexpression, it does not necessarily imply that regulatory divergence between species is the cause. Rather, genome-wide misexpression might occur as a downstream consequence of one or a small number of hybrid incompatibilities that effect gene regulation. It could also arise as a byproduct of hybrid dysfunction itself, which often involves gross defects in affected tissues (e.g., testes in male sterile hybrids) and abnormal or missing cell types. For example, although misexpression increases dramatically in hybrids between Drosophila species pairs with longer divergence times (Coolon et al. 2014), so does the severity of hybrid dysfunction.A promising approach to disentangle the causes of hybrid incompatibilities from their downstream effects is to examine interspecific gene expression variation associated with particular genomic regions. Although most studies of regulatory divergence compare gene expression profiles between parental species and F1 hybrids, a handful have used introgression lines (Lemos et al. 2008; Meiklejohn et al. 2014; Guerrero et al. 2016) or recombinant mapping populations (Turner et al. 2014), which can facilitate investigations into whether gene regulation and hybrid dysfunction have a shared genetic basis. With the introgression approach, it is possible to examine the regulatory effects of small genomic segments from one species on the genetic background of another species. If regulatory incompatibilities (i.e., gene misexpression in hybrids due to divergence in interacting cis- and trans-factors) are a common outcome of species divergence in gene regulatory networks, introgression of nearly any heterospecific segment is likely to cause some degree of gene misexpression. On the other hand, if widespread misexpression is confined to introgression hybrids carrying known incompatibility alleles, it is likely to be a downstream effect of hybrid dysfunction.To investigate the link between regulatory divergence and hybrid dysfunction, we exploited a well-studied hybrid incompatibility system between two closely related species of monkeyflower (Mimulus). Previously, we discovered severe male sterility and partial female sterility in hybrids between Mimulus guttatus (IM62 inbred line) and Mimulus nasutus (SF5 inbred line) (Sweigart et al. 2006) and fine mapped the effects to two small nuclear genomic regions of ∼60 kb each on chromosomes 6 and 13 (Sweigart and Flagel 2015). Hybrids that carry at least one incompatible M. guttatus IM62 allele at hybrid male sterility 1 (hms1) on chromosome 6 in combination with two incompatible M. nasutus SF5 alleles at hybrid male sterility 2 (hms2) on chromosome 13 display nearly complete (>90%) pollen sterility, whereas other allelic combinations are highly fertile (Sweigart et al. 2006; Sweigart and Flagel 2015; Kerwin and Sweigart 2017). Here, we took advantage of SF5–IM62 introgression hybrids, formed through multiple rounds of selection for pollen sterility and backcrossing (as the female parent) to M. nasutus SF5 (fig. 1). This recurrent selection with backcrossing (RSB) population maintains a heterozygous IM62 introgression on chromosome 6 (that contains the hms1 locus) against a primarily SF5 genetic background (including at hms2). Each generation, RSB progeny segregate ∼1:1 for sterility to fertility, depending on whether they inherit a copy of the incompatible IM62 hms1 allele. Additionally, nearly all RSB hybrids are expected to carry a non-sterility-causing, heterozygous IM62 introgression on chromosome 11 surrounding the female meiotic drive locus (D), which is transmitted to >98% of progeny when an SF5–IM62 F1 hybrid acts as the maternal parent (Fishman and Willis 2005). Thus, this crossing scheme produces two classes of progeny: sterile (STE) individuals that carry two heterozygous introgressions (on chromosome 6 with hms1 and on chromosome 11 with D) and fertile (FER) individuals that carry a single introgression (on chromosome 11 with D). The result is an internally controlled genetic experiment that is ideally suited for determining whether gene misexpression is a cause or consequence of hybrid sterility.Open in a separate windowFig. 1.Crossing scheme to generate RSB introgression hybrids. First, Mimulus nasutus SF5 and Mimulus guttatus IM62 were cross pollinated, yielding an SF5–IM62 F1 that was subsequently backcrossed to SF5, yielding a first-generation backcross (BC1) population. A pollen sterile individual from the BC1 population (circled in red) was selected and backcrossed to SF5, yielding a first-generation RSB introgression line (RSB1). This selective backcrossing was repeated for six more generations, producing an RSB7 population. Roughly, 50% of the RSB7 siblings are pollen STE because they carry an heterozygous introgression on chromosome 6 (with an incompatible IM62 allele at hms1) in an SF5 genomic background (that is fixed for the incompatible SF5 allele at hms2), whereas the other 50% are pollen FER because they carry only SF5 alleles at hms1 (in the same genomic background that is fixed for the incompatible SF5 allele at hms2). Whole transcriptome sequencing was performed on RNA extracted from three biological replicates each of stamens and carpels (gray box, bottom left) from four genotypes, M. nasutus SF5, M. guttatus IM62, FER RSB7 introgression hybrid, and STE RSB7 introgression hybrid, for a total of 24 samples, representing eight tissue-genotype categories. To obtain sufficient RNA for sequence library preparation, we dissected four to eight floral buds each biological replicate. D = meiotic drive locus (Fishman and Willis 2005).For this study, we sequenced the transcriptomes of FER and STE individuals from a seventh-generation RSB population (RSB7) alongside their parents, M. guttatus IM62 and M. nasutus SF5. Because the hms1–hms2 incompatibility affects both male and female fertility (Sweigart et al. 2006), we isolated RNA separately from developing stamens and carpels. This RNAseq data set allowed us to identify changes in gene expression due to the presence of a genomic segment that carries a known hybrid sterility allele (i.e., the IM62 allele at hms1) versus a genomic segment that does not (i.e., the IM62 allele at D). If regulatory incompatibilities between Mimulus species are common, we would expect to see misexpression (i.e., expression that falls outside the parental range) in both FER and STE introgression hybrids, due to heterospecific combinations of divergent cis- and trans-regulatory alleles. If instead, misexpression is confined to the affected tissues (i.e., stamens) of the STE introgression hybrid, it might suggest that downstream effects of the hms1–hms2 incompatibility are causal. With this RNAseq data set, we addressed the following specific questions. To what extent does gene expression vary between closely related Mimulus species? Are patterns of tissue-biased expression in stamens and carpels conserved between species? What are the relative contributions of cis- and trans-regulatory divergence to interspecific variation in gene expression? Is there an association between misexpression and hybrid sterility and, if so, what is its cause? Do expression patterns narrow down the list of candidate genes for hms1 or hms2? Our results provide insight into regulatory divergence between closely related species and the consequences for reproductive isolation. ResultsTo examine patterns of genome-wide expression associated with the hms1–hms2 hybrid incompatibility in Mimulus, we performed transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) on stamens and carpels from M. guttatus IM62, M. nasutus SF5, and FER and STE progeny of an advanced SF5–IM62 introgression population called recurrent selection with backcrossing (RSB7) (fig. 1). We obtained an average of 14.1 million (range, 10.9–16.8 million) 50-bp single-end reads from each sample (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). After initial processing, we aligned trimmed reads to a diploid M. guttatus IM62–M. nasutus SF5 pseudoreference genome generated for this study (see Materials and Methods for details). An average of 44.6% (range, 35.6–49.5%) of the reads were unambiguously assigned to an IM62 or SF5 allele (i.e., allele specific). An additional 34% (range, 29.5–36.9%) of the reads mapped to a single genomic location but could not be assigned to an IM62 or SF5 allele, due to an absence of distinguishing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). Across the 14 chromosomes, 20,431 of 28,140 predicted genes were expressed (i.e., read count-per-million [CPM] >1 in >2 samples).To determine introgression boundaries in the STE and FER RSB7 samples, we assigned genotypes using allele-specific reads (see Materials and Methods for details). As expected, STE and FER genotypes differ only in the region surrounding hms1 on chromosome 6: STE individuals contain a heterozygous IM62 introgression that stretches across a 7-Mb region encoding 699 genes (498 of which are expressed in our data set), whereas FER individuals are homozygous for the recurrent SF5 parent (supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online). Additionally, both FER and STE individuals carry a large heterozygous IM62 introgression that spans 23 Mb of chromosome 11 (90% of the physical distance; supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online), a region that encodes 1,066 genes (747 expressed in our data set) and harbors a female meiotic drive locus (D) associated with strong transmission ratio distortion in SF5–IM62 hybrids (Fishman and Willis 2005; Fishman and Saunders 2008).Expression Variation Is Driven by Species, Tissue, and FertilityTo visualize genome-wide expression patterns across the 24 samples in our data set, we generated a multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot (fig. 2). Replicate samples from each of the eight genotype-tissue groups form clusters that are generally separated from other groups (fig. 2). Along the x-axis of the MDS plot, expression variation is largely determined by tissue type with clear separation between carpel and stamen samples (fig. 2). Along the y-axis, samples are differentiated by a combination of tissue type and species identity, with stamens and carpels clustering separately, and IM62 clustering separately from SF5, FER, and STE (the latter two carrying SF5 variation across most of their genetic backgrounds; see supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online).Open in a separate windowFig. 2.Genome-wide expression pattern across samples. Shown is a MDS plot comparing gene expression across the 24 RNAseq samples in our data set. Distance between points represents the leading (i.e., largest absolute) log 2 fold-change (FC) transcript abundance between pairs of samples mapped onto two-dimensional space: the y-axis shows dimension 1 (dim 1) and the x-axis shows dimension two (dim 2). The colors and shapes represent the different genotype-tissue categories. IM62, Mimulus guttatus IM62 parent; SF5, Mimulus nasutus SF5 parent; FER, fertile RSB7 introgression hybrid; STE, sterile RSB7 introgression hybrid; FERcp, FER carpel; FERst, FER stamen; IM62cp, IM62 carpel; IM62st, IM62 stamen; SF5cp, SF5 carpel; SF5st, SF5 stamen; STEcp, STE carpel; STEst, STE stamen.To investigate these differences more thoroughly, we compared patterns of tissue-biased gene expression between IM62 and SF5 (fig. 3). For a large number of genes, tissue-biased expression is conserved between species: 7,512 genes (37%) show higher or lower expression in the same tissues in both IM62 and SF5 (green points in fig. 3). On the other hand, a considerable number of genes (4,728, 23%; blue and yellow points in fig. 3) show tissue-biased expression in only one of the two species and a handful (78, 0.4%; purple points in fig. 3) even show opposite patterns of tissue-biased expression. We also looked more closely at interspecific expression variation between IM62 and SF5 within carpels and stamens (supplementary fig. S2, Supplementary Material online). Among the 20,431 expressed genes in our data set, we found that 2,037 (10%) and 2,341 (11%) were significantly differentially expressed (log 2 fold-change > 1.25, false discovery rate [FDR] ≤ 0.05) between SF5 and IM62 in carpels and stamens, respectively (supplementary fig. S2, Supplementary Material online).Open in a separate windowFig. 3.Parental tissue-biased gene expression. Scatterplot shows relative transcript abundance (log 2 fold-change) between stamen and carpel tissues in the SF5 and IM62 parents. Of the 20,431 genes expressed in our data set, 1,812 (8.9%) and 5,700 (27.9%) were significantly (log 2 FC > 1.25, FDR ≤ 0.05) stamen biased (green points in top right quadrant) and carpel biased (green points in bottom left quadrant), respectively, in both parents. An additional 546 (2.7%) and 1,339 (6.6%) genes were stamen biased and carpel biased, respectively, in SF5 only (blue points), whereas 615 (3%) and 2,228 (10.9%) genes were stamen biased and carpel biased, respectively, in IM62 only (yellow points). A few genes exhibited opposing tissue-biased expression patterns in SF5 and IM62 (purple points): 28 (0.1%) were stamen biased in SF5 and carpel biased in IM62, whereas 50 (0.2%) were carpel biased in SF5 and stamen biased in IM62. The remaining 8,113 (39.7%) genes were evenly expressed between parental tissues (gray points). IM62, Mimulus guttatus IM62 parent; SF5, Mimulus nasutus SF5 parent.A conspicuous exception to the species-tissue clustering pattern just described is the distinct group formed by the STE stamen samples (see red asterisks in fig. 2). We reasoned that this unique pattern of gene expression in STE stamens might be driven by the presence of the chromosome 6 introgression, which carries the hybrid male sterility-causing IM62 hms1 allele. To investigate this possibility, we compared gene expression profiles among STE, FER, and SF5 samples (fig. 4). Indeed, the vast majority of differentially expressed genes were identified in comparisons of stamens with and without the chromosome 6 introgression: of the 20,431 genes expressed in our data set, 4,846 (24%) were differentially expressed (3,207 upregulated, 1,639 downregulated) in stamens across both STE versus FER and STE versus SF5 (fig. 4). Moreover, differentially expressed STE stamen genes were distributed throughout the genome, with roughly equal proportions in the introgression (25%, 313/1,245) and background (24%, 4,512/19,186) regions (supplementary fig. S3, Supplementary Material online). In contrast, far fewer expression differences were found in comparisons of stamens distinguished only by the chromosome 11 introgression (fig. 4, FER vs. SF5 and STE vs. SF5: 4 upregulated, 0 downregulated). Additionally, relatively few genes were differentially expressed in carpels, whether they carried the chromosome 6 introgression or not (across all comparisons: 24 upregulated, 3 downregulated). Despite the fact that the chromosome 6 introgression causes a substantial reduction in female fertility in STE hybrids (supplemental seed set of FER RSB3 is >4× that of STE RSB3, fig. 6 in Sweigart et al. 2006), it appears to have little effect on gene expression in the carpels we collected.Open in a separate windowFig. 4.Gene expression differences across genotypes and tissues. Venn diagrams show counts of genes with significantly altered transcript abundance (log 2 fold-change > 1.25, FDR ≤ 0.05) in carpels and stamens across three pairwise comparisons: 1) STE versus FER, 2) STE versus SF5, and 3) FER versus SF5.

Because patterns of relative expression are expected to differ between heterozygous genes located within the introgressions and homozygous genes located in the background (which carry two SF5 alleles), we plotted these gene classes separately.Open in a separate windowFig. 5.Genome-wide pattern of expression in FER introgression hybrids.

IM62, Mimulus guttatus IM62 parent; SF5, Mimulus nasutus SF5 parent; FER, fertile RSB7 introgression hybrid.Patterns of relative transcript abundance in FER carpels, FER stamens, and STE carpels (i.e., tissues unaffected by hybrid sterility) are reflective of both additive and dominant inheritance of regulatory variants from SF5 and IM62. Among the heterozygous introgression genes that exhibited significant (log 2 fold-change > 1.25, FDR ≤ 0.05) parental expression divergence (labeled “divergent” in figs. 5 and ​and6),6), up to half showed intermediate levels of expression in FER carpels (39% [26/66]), FER stamens (50% [39/78]), and STE carpels (51% [53/104]) (green points/bars in figs. 5A and B and 6A and C and supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online), consistent with the additive effects of cis-regulatory alleles. The other half of these divergent heterozygous introgression genes exhibited SF5-like or IM62-like expression (dark blue and orange points/bars in figs. 5A and B and 6A and C and supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online), which could result from dominance of one cis-acting variant over the other. Consistent with this possibility, expression of heterozygous genes usually matched the more highly expressed parent (note the bias toward positive values in figs. 5A and B and 6A and C). Dominance of a high-expression allele might be caused by a cis-mutation that increases its own transcription (whereas a dominant cis-acting, low-expression allele would have to interfere with expression from the alternate allele). Dominant effects of trans-acting factors on gene expression in the heterozygous introgressions are also apparent: More divergent genes exhibited SF5-like than IM62-like expression, suggesting a strong influence of trans-factors from the SF5 background (compare dark blue SF5-like points/bars with orange IM62-like bars in figs. 5A and B and 6A and C and supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online). Similarly, although 82–85% of the divergent background genes were SF5-like due to their homozygosity for SF5 alleles (blue points/bars in figs. 5C and D and ​and6E6E and supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online), a substantial proportion (15–18%) showed intermediate expression (green points/bars) signifying incomplete dominance of IM62 trans-alleles from the heterozygous introgressions. Very few divergent background genes were IM62-like (orange points/bars) or misexpressed (light and dark pink points/bars; figs. 5C and D and ​and6E6E and supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online).The pattern of expression in STE stamens differed dramatically from all other samples, with a large number of genes misexpressed (22% [4,533/20,431]; light and dark pink points/bars in fig. 6B, D, and F and supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online). The vast majority of misexpression was found in genes that exhibited expression conservation between the parents (light pink points/bars in fig. 6F). Additionally, STE stamens showed a marked increase in genes with IM62-like expression, including in background regions where genes are homozygous for SF5 alleles (7% [1,435/19,186] IM62-like in background; yellow and orange points in fig. 6B, D, and F and supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online).The fact that misexpression was almost entirely restricted to STE stamens suggests it might be a downstream effect of the hybrid male sterility phenotype. Consistent with this idea, we observed an overrepresentation of stamen-biased genes among the 2,062 genes that were downregulated in STE stamens compared with FER and SF5 stamens (see fig. 4): 83% (1,715) were stamen biased in one or both parents, whereas only 5% (108) were carpel biased in one or both parents (supplementary fig. S4, Supplementary Material online). On the other hand, of the 5,344 genes upregulated in STE stamens compared with FER and SF5 stamens, only 6% (344) were stamen biased in one or both parents and 74% (3,953) were carpel biased (supplementary fig. S4, Supplementary Material online). Moreover, we found that both downregulated STE stamen genes and parental stamen-biased genes were enriched in Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to pollen development (e.g., pollen tube growth, cell tip growth), whereas upregulated STE stamen genes and parental carpel-biased genes were enriched in photosynthesis-related GO terms (supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material online).Large Effects of Both cis- and trans-Regulatory Divergence between SpeciesTo characterize patterns of regulatory divergence in Mimulus, we compared expression differences between species (M. nasutus SF5 and M. guttatus IM62) with relative expression of SF5 and IM62 alleles (i.e., allele-specific expression) within FER and STE heterozygous introgression genes (fig. 7 and supplementary table S5, Supplementary Material online). Because these heterozygous genes carry an allele from each parent expressed in a common trans environment, cis-regulatory divergence between SF5 and IM62 is expected to produce biased allele-specific expression in FER and STE tissues. Similarly, divergence in one or more trans-factors will affect overall transcript abundance of FER and STE introgression genes without disrupting allele-specific expression. In contrast, compensating cis and trans mutations may result in expression conservation between SF5 and IM62, despite divergence in the underlying regulatory machinery. To avoid overestimating compensatory changes, in this analysis, we eliminated the log 2 fold-change > 1.25 threshold requirement for detecting expression differences (see Materials and Methods). Consequently, 40–46% (304–566) of the heterozygous introgression genes evaluated in FER and STE tissues exhibited significant (FDR ≤ 0.05) parental expression divergence (supplementary table S5, Supplementary Material online).Open in a separate windowFig. 7.Classification of parental cis- and trans-regulatory divergence across heterozygous genes in FER and STE introgression hybrids. Points represent relative transcript abundance (log 2 fold-change) between the parents, SF5 and IM62, on the x-axis (log 2[SF5/IM62] parents) and relative abundance of SF5- and IM62-specific transcripts in the hybrids on the y-axis (log 2[SF5/IM62] hybrid) across (A, B) FER and (C–F) STE tissues (i.e., carpels and stamens) for heterozygous genes in the (C, D) chromosome 6 and (A–D) chromosome 11 introgression regions. The diagonal line indicates relative parental expression (i.e., log 2[SF5/IM62] parents) and relative allelic expression (i.e., log 2[SF5/IM62] hybrid) are equal. Points that fall along the diagonal line represent genes for whom parental expression differences are entirely explained by cis-regulatory divergence. Points are colored by regulatory divergence category. IM62, Mimulus guttatus IM62 parent; SF5, Mimulus nasutus SF5 parent; FER, fertile RSB7 introgression hybrid; STE, sterile RSB7 introgression hybrid.Among these divergent heterozygous introgression genes, regulatory divergence in FER and STE tissues was primarily categorized as trans only (135–337, 39–60%; green points/bars in fig. 7 and supplementary table S5, Supplementary Material online) or cis only (120–215, 23–45%; purple points/bars in fig. 7 and supplementary table S5, Supplementary Material online), with smaller contributions from cis + trans reinforcing (9–18, 2–4%; blue points/bars in fig. 7 and supplementary table S5, Supplementary Material online), cis + trans opposing (24–2, 8–9%; yellow points/bars in fig. 7 and supplementary table S5, Supplementary Material online) and cis × trans (7–34, 2–6%; maroon points/bars in fig. 7 and supplementary table S5, Supplementary Material online). Among the 54–60% (407–731) of heterozygous introgression genes that exhibited parental expression conservation, the majority also exhibited regulatory conservation (278–509, 68–73%; gray points/bars in fig. 7 and supplementary table S5, Supplementary Material online), though 11–13% (45–89) of these genes showed evidence of compensatory cis–trans evolution in FER and STE tissues (orange points/bars in fig. 7 and supplementary table S5, Supplementary Material online). Importantly, genes with compensating cis and trans changes (i.e., cis + trans opposing, cis × trans, and compensatory) were no more likely to be misexpressed than genes in other regulatory categories (supplementary fig. S5 and S6 and table S6, Supplementary Material online): in STE stamens, 18% of genes with evidence of compensating cis and trans divergence were misexpressed compared with 26% of genes with conserved regulation (χ(compensating cis and trans vs. conserved)2 = 3.77, P value = 0.052) and 18% of genes with other forms of regulatory divergence (χ(compensating cis and trans vs. other)2 = 0.01, P value = 0.904).As discussed in the previous section, misexpression is widespread in STE stamens, including in the heterozygous introgressions (fig. 6 and supplementary fig. S5C–F, Supplementary Material online). If misexpression in STE stamens is due largely to downstream effects of the hms1–hms2 incompatibility and/or disrupted tissues, using these samples to infer mechanisms of regulatory divergence could be problematic (e.g., if allele-specific expression is affected by altered cellular composition, not by species differences in cis- and trans-regulation). Although the proportions of genes in each regulatory divergence category are fairly similar across fertile and sterile tissues (fig. 7), we note that inferences from the STE stamen samples (fig. 7D and F), which show a proportional increase in trans-only and decrease in cis-only genes, should be made with caution.Gene Expression in hms1 and hms2 Intervals Points to Candidate GenesIn addition to examining genome-wide patterns of expression, we wanted to investigate individual genes in the hms1- and hms2-mapped intervals to identify candidates for Mimulus hybrid sterility. Our expectation was that the causal genes for severe hybrid male sterility and partial hybrid female sterility would be expressed in stamens, and possibly, in carpels. Additionally, if the hms1–hms2 incompatibility is mediated by expression changes, we might expect the causal genes to show differences in expression between species and/or between fertile and sterile introgression lines.Of the 11 genes in the hms1 interval, we were able to evaluate expression for eight of them (table 1). Among these eight genes, five were expressed at moderate to high levels (fragments per kilobase per million reads sequenced >2) in stamens, with one, Migut.{""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""F01606"",""term_id"":""645163"",""term_text"":""F01606""}}F01606, exhibiting significant (log 2 fold-change > 1.25, FDR ≤ 0.05) stamen bias in SF5, FER, and STE (table 1 and supplementary table S7, Supplementary Material online). Migut.{""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""F01606"",""term_id"":""645163"",""term_text"":""F01606""}}F01606 also showed expression differences between species and between introgression lines: Expression was significantly (log 2 fold-change > 1.25, FDR ≤ 0.05) higher in SF5 and FER stamens compared with IM62 and STE stamens. One of the genes in hms1, Migut.{""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""F01612"",""term_id"":""645169"",""term_text"":""F01612""}}F01612, shows copy number variation between species: This gene and its highly similar paralog (Migut.{""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""F01618"",""term_id"":""645175"",""term_text"":""F01618""}}F01618) are present in IM62 but absent in SF5 (Kerwin RE and Sweigart AL, unpublished results). Because of its absence from the genome, expression is precluded in SF5 and FER samples.

Transcript abundances below our threshold of one CPM are denoted by “—.” IM62, Mimulus guttatus IM62 parent; SF5, Mimulus nasutus SF5 parent; FER, fertile RSB7 introgression hybrid; STE, sterile RSB7 introgression hybrid. Color indicates expression intensity from low (blue) to high (red).Of the five genes in the hms2 interval, three were expressed at moderate to high levels in stamens, with Migut.M00297 showing significant (log 2 fold-change > 1.25, FDR ≤ 0.05) stamen bias in IM62, SF5, and FER samples (table 1 and supplementary table S7, Supplementary Material online). Two genes (Migut.M00296 and Migut.M00298) were significantly (log 2 fold-change > 1.25, FDR ≤ 0.05) carpel biased with very little/no expression in IM62, SF5, FER, and STE stamens, making them unlikely candidates for the hms2 causal gene. Intriguingly, Migut.M00297 expression was significantly (log 2 fold-change > 1.25, FDR ≤ 0.05) lower in STE stamens compared with IM62, SF5, and FER. This pattern is precisely what is expected if the IM62 hms1 allele (in the STE chromosome 6 introgression) directly affects expression of the causal hms2 gene. From this analysis, then, Migut.M00297 emerges as a strong candidate for hms2. DiscussionMisexpression is a common feature of hybrids between closely related species, but the causal mechanisms and evolutionary significance are not always clear. Aberrant patterns of gene expression in sterile or inviable hybrids could be due to regulatory incompatibilities—which would implicate divergence in regulatory networks as a driver of reproductive isolation—or to the downstream effects of disrupted tissues. In this study, we took advantage of introgression hybrids between closely related Mimulus species to distinguish between the potential causes of misexpression. Although we discovered substantial regulatory divergence between M. guttatus and M. nasutus, the fact that a heterozygous introgression spanning most of chromosome 11 caused almost no misexpression suggests that regulatory incompatibilities are not pervasive. Instead, we found that misexpression was confined to the affected tissues (i.e., stamens) of individuals carrying a sterility-causing introgression on chromosome 6, suggesting widespread effects of the hms1–hms2 incompatibility on gene regulation.Despite the recentness of their split (∼200 ka, Brandvain et al. 2014), M. guttatus and M. nasutus showed considerable variation in gene expression, with ∼10% of genes differentially expressed between species in stamens and/or carpels. Extensive expression divergence over short evolutionary timescales has also been observed in animals (Rottscheidt and Harr 2007; Renaut et al. 2009; Coolon et al. 2014) and other plant systems (Fujimoto et al. 2011; Combes et al. 2015). However, we note that because nucleotide divergence between these Mimulus species barely exceeds diversity within M. guttatus (ds = 4.94% and πs-M. guttatus = 4.91%, Brandvain et al. 2014), much of the observed expression variation between M. guttatus IM62 and M. nasutus SF5 might be segregating within species. We also observed more tissue-biased gene expression in M. guttatus than in M. nasutus (see fig. 3: IM62 has ∼10% more genes with carpel- and stamen-biased expression). An intriguing possibility is that this difference might reflect divergence in reproductive traits associated with the species’ distinct mating systems (selfing vs. outcrossing).Our targeted look at gene expression in two heterozygous introgressions suggests that regulatory differences between Mimulus species are due to divergence in both trans-factors and cis-regulatory sequences. This finding runs counter to the expectation that interspecific regulatory variation should be influenced primarily by changes to cis-regulatory sequences, which have fewer pleiotropic effects (Wray et al. 2003; Wittkopp et al. 2008). However, it is in agreement with several recent studies showing that cis-changes do not always predominate between closely related species (McManus et al. 2010; Meiklejohn et al. 2014; Combes et al. 2015; Guerrero et al. 2016; Metzger et al. 2017). When two lineages have split only recently, some of their regulatory differences might still be polymorphic within species, with purifying selection having had insufficient time to remove deleterious trans-regulatory variants. This argument, along with evidence that mutations in trans-factors arise more frequently (Landry et al. 2007), might explain the higher than expected contribution of trans-acting factors to regulatory variation observed within species (Wittkopp et al. 2008; Emerson et al. 2010), as well as between closely related species. In the case of the two Mimulus species studied here, an additional factor may affect trans-regulatory divergence: Deleterious mutations might be particularly likely to accumulate in M. nasutus because of its shift to self-fertilization. Indeed, this species shows genomic signatures that indicate a reduction in the efficacy of purifying selection (Brandvain et al. 2014), an expected outcome of the lower effective population size and recombination rate that accompanies the evolution of selfing (Nordborg 2000; Charlesworth and Wright 2001).In addition to cis- and trans-only regulatory divergence between these Mimulus species, our analyses of the two heterozygous introgressions uncovered some evidence of compensatory cis–trans evolution. Interestingly, however, we found little indication that this process acts as a general driver of regulatory incompatibilities. Genes with evidence of compensating cis and trans (i.e., cis + trans opposing, cis × trans, and compensatory) divergence were no more likely to be misexpressed in STE stamens than genes with conserved regulation (supplementary fig. S6 and table S6, Supplementary Material online). This result is somewhat surprising because compensatory changes within species are expected to cause mismatches between heterospecific cis- and trans-regulators in hybrids, leading to aberrant gene expression and, potentially, hybrid dysfunction (Landry et al. 2005). In support of this idea, several studies have shown that genes with cis- and trans-variants that act in opposing directions (i.e., cis + trans opposing, cis × trans, and compensatory) are enriched among genes that are misexpressed in hybrids (Tirosh et al. 2009; McManus et al. 2010; Schaefke et al. 2013; Mack et al. 2016). On the other hand, it has been argued that cis × trans effects might often be inflated (Fraser 2019), and, in some cases, the association is missing altogether (Bell et al. 2013; Coolon et al. 2014).What is clear from our study is that species divergence in cis- and trans-regulatory elements cannot explain the vast majority of the gene misexpression we observe in Mimulus introgression hybrids. Instead, the fact that widespread misexpression is confined to sterile tissues suggests it is a downstream consequence of the hms1–hms2 incompatibility. Indeed, introgressing a 7-Mb genomic segment with the hms1 incompatibility allele from M. guttatus into M. nasutus has profound effects on male fertility, with STE individuals producing few pollen grains, nearly all of which are inviable. Coincident with this male sterility, STE stamens showed dramatic expression differences when compared with parental lines, with 22% of all genes misexpressed (N = 20,431; fig. 6 and supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online). In stark contrast, introgressing a genomic segment from chromosome 11 that is much larger in size (23 Mb) but does not carry any known hybrid incompatibility alleles, resulted in only a single misexpressed transcript in stamens (i.e., in FER individuals; fig. 5 and supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online). The fact that neither introgression showed strong effects on expression in carpels suggests that partial hybrid female sterility either has little impact on gene regulation or manifests later in development.Our study highlights the challenge of establishing a causal link between divergent regulatory alleles and the evolution of hybrid incompatibilities. When hybrid misexpression is discovered, it is often confounded with the phenotypic effects of hybrid dysfunction, such as defective tissues and/or disrupted development (Ortíz-Barrientos et al. 2007; Wei et al. 2014). For example, when normally inviable F1 hybrid males between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans are rescued by a mutation in the hybrid incompatibility gene Hmr, gene expression in larvae becomes much more similar to parents (Wei et al. 2014). Like with the hms1–hms2 incompatibility in Mimulus, this result suggests a large effect of the Hmr gene on genome-wide hybrid misexpression in Drosophila. A similar result was also seen in a previous study of M. nasutus–M. guttatus F2 hybrids: The number of differentially expressed genes between parents and lethal F2 seedlings that lack chlorophyll due to a two-locus hybrid incompatibility is much higher than between parents and viable F2 seedlings (Zuellig and Sweigart 2018). Taken together, these studies suggest that caution should be taken when assigning a cause to hybrid gene misexpression. At the same time, it is important to note that our results do not rule out regulatory divergence as a cause of Mimulus hybrid incompatibilities in particular cases, including hms1 and hms2.An additional outcome of our analyses is a shortened list of likely candidate genes for causing the hms1–hms2 incompatibility. Previously, we mapped hms1 to an interval containing 11 annotated genes with three strong functional candidates: Migut.{""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""F01605"",""term_id"":""645162"",""term_text"":""F01605""}}F01605, Migut.{""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""F01606"",""term_id"":""645163"",""term_text"":""F01606""}}F01606, and Migut.{""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""F01612"",""term_id"":""645169"",""term_text"":""F01612""}}F01612 (Sweigart and Flagel 2015). The first two are tandem duplicates of SKP1-like genes, which form part of the SKP1–Cullin–F-box protein E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that regulates many developmental processes including the cell cycle (Hellmann and Estelle 2002). Although we did not detect Migut.{""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""F01605"",""term_id"":""645162"",""term_text"":""F01605""}}F01605 expression in any sample (potentially calling into question its functionality), Migut.{""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""F01606"",""term_id"":""645163"",""term_text"":""F01606""}}F01606 remains a strong candidate. Expression of this gene was significantly (log 2 fold-change > 1.25, FDR ≤ 0.05) stamen biased in FER, STE, and SF5 and significantly higher in SF5 and FER than IM62 or STE (table 1). If Migut.{""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""F01606"",""term_id"":""645163"",""term_text"":""F01606""}}F01606 is causal for hms1, the fact that the normally expressed SF5 allele is significantly reduced in heterozygous STE individuals suggests that the IM62 allele interferes with its expression. An alternative possibility is that reduced expression of Migut.{""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""F01606"",""term_id"":""645163"",""term_text"":""F01606""}}F01606 in STE is simply a downstream effect of the hybrid male sterility phenotype. Migut.{""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""F01612"",""term_id"":""645169"",""term_text"":""F01612""}}F01612, an F-box gene, also remains a strong candidate for hms1. Although the RNAseq results provided little additional insight into the function of this gene (transcript abundance did not pass our expression threshold of one CPM in any genotype-tissue group), we have observed its expression in IM62 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (data not shown) and its absence from the SF5 genome is notable.At hms2, expression patterns of Migut.M00297 strengthen it as a candidate. This gene encodes the second-largest subunit (RPB2) of RNA Polymerase II—the multi-subunit enzyme responsible for mRNA transcription (Woychik and Hampsey 2002; Hahn 2004). In most flowering plant species, RPB2 is a single copy gene. However, within the asterid clade, two distinct paralogs (RPB2-i and RPB2-d) are present, having been retained following an ancient duplication event (Oxelman et al. 2004; Luo et al. 2007). In all asterid species that have been investigated, the expression pattern of RPB2-i suggests that it is restricted to male reproductive structures (e.g., stamen and pollen) (Oxelman et al. 2004; Luo et al. 2007). In our experiment, expression of Migut.M00297, which encodes the RPB2-i paralog, was significantly (log 2 fold-change > 1.25, FDR ≤ 0.05) stamen biased in both parents and in FER but significantly underexpressed in STE individuals (table 1). Although this is the pattern expected if the IM62 hms1 allele (in the STE chromosome 6 introgression) directly affects the expression of the causal hms2 gene, it might also arise as a byproduct of hms1–hms2 sterility. Of course, an important consideration is that, for both hms1 and hms2, the difference between compatible and incompatible alleles might have nothing to do with transcription. For each of these loci, then, additional approaches such as transformation experiments will be needed to identify the causal genes.In addition to the main findings just discussed, our study has revealed a dramatic suppression of recombination in the RSB introgression population. Despite eight rounds of backcrossing to M. nasutus SF5, the heterozygous introgressions on chromosomes 6 and 11 remain quite large (7 and 23 Mb, respectively). With uniform recombination rates and Mendelian transmission, FER and STE individuals are expected to be heterozygous along ∼0.2% of their genome, which equates to a maximum introgression size of ∼0.625 Mb (M. guttatus genome ∼312 Mb). Suppressed recombination rates on chromosome 6 were previously observed in an earlier generation of the RSB population (Sweigart et al. 2006). At the time, we speculated that low recombination might be a direct cause of the hms1–hms2 incompatibility—perhaps due to a meiotic defect. However, follow-up work performing testcrosses with F2 hybrids that carried either incompatible or compatible genotypes at hms1 and hms2 showed no effect of the hms1–hms2 incompatibility on recombination rates (data not shown). Additionally, we have observed a similar reduction in recombination in heterospecific introgressions when attempting to generate nearly isogenic lines using other Mimulus accessions that lack the hms1–hms2 incompatibility. A possible explanation for the suppressed recombination on chromosomes 6 and 11 is that local sequence diversity affects recombination in Mimulus. Nucleotide diversity between chromosome homologs is much higher in heterospecific introgressions than in adjacent isogenic regions. Thus, if sequence diversity affects the likelihood of DNA double-strand breaks and/or crossover events, as it does in mice (Li et al. 2019), we would expect much lower recombination in the heterozygous introgressions. Given the extraordinarily high nucleotide diversity within M. guttatus (Brandvain et al. 2014; Puzey et al. 2017), if this explanation is correct, we might expect extensive natural variation in recombination rates even within species. Materials and MethodsPlant Lines and Growth ConditionsThis study focuses on M. guttatus and M. nasutus, two closely related species that diverged roughly 200,000 years ago (Brandvain et al. 2014). Previous work identified two nuclear incompatibility loci, hms1 and hms2, that cause nearly complete (>90%) male sterility and partial female sterility in a fraction of F2 hybrids between an inbred line of M. guttatus from Iron Mountain, Oregon (IM62), and a naturally inbred M. nasutus line from Sherar’s Falls, Oregon (SF5) (Sweigart et al. 2006). We generated an introgression population carrying incompatible (IM62) and compatible (SF5) hms1 alleles in a common genetic background fixed for the incompatible (SF5) hms2 allele, through multiple rounds of selection for pollen sterility and backcrossing to the recurrent SF5 parent (Sweigart et al. 2006). Briefly, M. nasutus SF5 and M. guttatus IM62 were intercrossed (with SF5 as the maternal parent) to create an F1 hybrid that was backcrossed to SF5 (with the F1 as the maternal parent), producing a first-generation backcross (BC1) population that segregates four hms1–hms2 genotypes (fig. 1). Next, a pollen sterile individual selected from the BC1 population was backcrossed to SF5, yielding the first generation of an introgression population dubbed recurrent selection with backcrossing (RSB1) (Sweigart et al. 2006). This selective backcrossing scheme was repeated six more times, producing an RSB7 population that segregates ∼1:1 for two genotypes: pollen STE individuals carrying the incompatible IM62 allele at hms1and pollen FER individuals homozygous for the compatible SF5 allele at hms1, both in a genetic background fixed for the incompatible (SF5) hms2 allele (fig. 1).All plants were grown in a growth chamber at the University of Georgia. Seeds were sown into 2.5-in. pots containing Fafard 3B potting mix (Sun Gro Horticulture, Agawam, MA), stratified for 7 days at 4 °C, then transferred to a growth chamber set to 22 °C day/16 °C night, 16-h day length. Plants were bottom-watered daily and fertilized as needed using Jack’s Professional Blossom Booster (J.R. Peter’s, Inc., Allentown, PA). To identify FER and STE RSB7 genotypes prior to bud formation, plants were genotyped at markers flanking hms1 and hms2. To verify the fertility phenotypes, the first flower on each RSB7 plant was allowed to self-pollinate. Within 3–5 days postanthesis, fertilized fruits (on FER plants) begin to mature and plump, whereas the unfertilized fruits (on STE plants) remain immature and small, making it easy to differentiate the two phenotypic classes.Sample Collection and Transcriptome SequencingFor this study, we generated 24 whole transcriptome libraries: three biological replicates each of two tissue types (stamens and carpels) from four genotypes that vary at hms1 and hms2 (M. guttatus IM62, M. nasutus SF5, RSB7 FER, and RSB7 STE; fig. 1 and supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). To identify FER and STE individuals from the RSB7 population prior to flowering, we genotyped the plants using PCR-based markers flanking hms1 and hms2. To collect sufficient tissue for each biological replicate, we carefully dissected 8–24 preanthesis floral buds and transferred carpel and stamen tissue into separate 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes partially submerged in liquid nitrogen (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). We extracted RNA using a QuickRNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) then measured RNA concentration using a Qubit RNA BR (Broad-Range) Assay Kit and a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). We shipped RNA samples overnight on dry ice to the Duke Center for Genomic and Computational Biology (Durham, NC), where the Sequencing and Genomic Technologies core checked RNA quality using an Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), constructed sequencing libraries using a KAPA Stranded mRNA-Seq Kit (F. Hoffmann-L Roche, Basel, Switzerland), and sequenced all 24 libraries on a single lane of HiSeq 4000 (Illumina, Inc. San Diego, CA), producing 50-base pair single-end reads (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). The raw fastq files are available to download from the Sequence Read Archive database (supplementary table S8, Supplementary Material online).Pseudoreference Genome Construction and Competitive Transcriptome AlignmentAn important consideration for genomic and transcriptomic analyses is potential mapping bias introduced when aligning reads from one species against a reference from another species (Degner et al. 2009). The four genotypes in this study represent two pure species, M. guttatus IM62 and M. nasutus SF5, as well as FER and STE individuals from the RSB7 population that are expected to carry SF5 alleles across >90% of their genomes. Previous work has shown that nucleotide divergence between M. guttatus and M. nasutus is substantial (ds = 4.94%, see Brandvain et al. 2014). Therefore, aligning SF5, FER, and STE reads against the M. guttatus v2.0 reference (which is based on the IM62 accession; Hellsten et al. 2013) is likely to introduce mapping bias: Reads from nonreference alleles may align incorrectly, nonuniquely, or not at all due to mismatch errors. To ameliorate this issue, we constructed a diploid M. guttatus IM62–M. nasutus SF5 pseudoreference genome and competitively mapped all RNAseq reads against it.First, we constructed a M. nasutus pseudoreference genome using publicly available SF5 whole genome (gDNA) sequence data. Using the fastq-dump command from the NCBI toolkit, we retrieved the SF5 gDNA fastq files from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive database (SRR400478). To prepare the 75-bp paired-end sequences for alignment, we trimmed adapters and low-quality bases, then filtered out processed reads shorter than 50 bp using Trimmomatic (Bolger et al. 2014). We aligned the trimmed 50- to 75-bp paired-end reads to the M. guttatus v2.0 reference genome using BWA-MEM (Li and Durbin 2009; Li 2013). We removed optical and PCR duplicates from the initial SF5 alignment using Picard MarkDuplicates (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard; last accessed December 20, 2019) then filtered out reads with an alignment quality below Q20 with SAMtools view command (Li et al. 2009). Next, we generated a set of high-quality SNPs for M. nasutus SF5 pseudoreference genome construction. Using GATK HaplotypeCaller in GVCF mode followed by GATK GenotypeGVCFs, we identified phased SNP and insertion/deletion (indel) variants from the SF5 alignment (McKenna et al. 2010; Poplin et al. 2017). From there, we extracted biallelic SNPs with GATK SelectVariants and filtered out sites with a mapping quality below 40 or quality by depth below two using GATK VariantFiltration. Using the filtered SNPs, we created a M. nasutus SF5 pseudoreference genome with GATK FastaAlternateReferenceMaker. Finally, we constructed a diploid M. guttatus IM62–M. nasutus SF5 pseudoreference genome by appending allelic (i.e., IM62 or SF5) identifiers onto the chromosome names in the M. guttatus v2.0 reference and M. nasutus SF5 pseudoreference fasta files, then merging them manually into a single file. We similarly created a diploid annotation file by appending allelic identifiers onto chromosome, gene, and transcript names, then combining the two files.To generate RNAseq alignments, we mapped all four genotypes (IM62, SF5, FER, and STE) to the diploid pseudoreference genome. Prior to mapping, we trimmed adapter sequences and low-quality bases from the raw RNAseq reads, then filtered out reads shorter than 36 bp using Trimmomatic (Bolger et al. 2014) (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). We mapped the resulting 36–50-bp single-end RNAseq reads using STAR (Dobin et al. 2013; Dobin and Gingeras 2015). Reads that overlap a SNP are expected to map uniquely to an SF5 or IM62 allele in the pseudoreference genome, whereas reads that do not overlap a SNP will map equally well to both alleles. We limited each read to a maximum of two alignments by specifying –outFilterMultimapNmax 2. With this approach, >98.6% of reads mapped to a single genomic location, whether they mapped uniquely to one allele or not. For reads with two alignments, we randomly designated one as primary by specifying –outMultimapperOrder Random. Then, we removed secondary alignments and unmapped reads using SAMtools view, leaving just unique (i.e., allele specific) and primary alignments. We filtered out optical and PCR duplicates with Picard MarkDuplicates, then parsed intron-spanning reads into exon segments and trimmed off bases that extended into intronic regions using GATK SplitNCigarReads (McKenna et al. 2010). Finally, with SAMtools view, we filtered based on mapping quality to obtain high-quality alignments with two kinds of reads: 1) allele-specific and primary mapping (i.e., total), using a Q20 threshold or 2) just allele specific, using a Q60 threshold, which designates unique alignments.Genotyping and Determination of Heterozygous Introgression BoundariesTo determine the heterozygous introgression boundaries for the FER and STE samples, we counted allele-specific reads from the Q60 alignments using HTSeq-count (Anders et al. 2015), with the nonunique parameter set to none, and converted the read counts to binary presence/absence values for genotyping. First, to ensure that only expressed genes were used for genotyping, we set read counts below 10 to 0. Then, we converted all read counts above 0 to 1. Using the binary read count scores from the IM62 and SF5 alleles, we assigned one of four genotypes to each gene in each sample: 1) IM62 (IM62 = 1, SF5 = 0), 2) HET (IM62 = 1, SF5 = 1), 3) SF5 (IM62 = 0, SF5 = 1), and 4) nonexpressed (IM62 = 0, SF5 = 0). To obtain a single genotype call per gene for FER and STE individuals, we pooled the six biological replicates from each line. The majority of FER and STE genotype calls were HET or SF5, though a few were IM62. The erroneous IM62 genotype assignments could be caused by a number of reasons, including 1) the SF5 allele was not expressed our samples, 2) sequencing error caused an SF5-derived read to match IM62, or 3) the gene is absent from the SF5 genome. We dropped the erroneous IM62 genotype calls, which eliminated 26 and 39 FER and STE genes, respectively, resulting in genotype assignments for 18,680 and 18,675 genes across the 14 Mimulus chromosomes.Differential Gene Expression Analysis and Gene Expression Category AssignmentTo quantify total transcript abundance, we counted total (i.e., allele-specific and primary mapping) reads from the processed Q20 alignments using HTSeq-count (Anders et al. 2015), with the nonunique parameter set to all. We used these raw read counts to perform differential gene expression analysis in edgeR (Robinson et al. 2010). To restrict comparisons to genes expressed in at least one genotype-tissue group, we only analyzed genes with at least one read CPM in three or more of the 24 libraries. This filtering step removed 7,188 genes, resulting in a set of 20,952 expressed genes, 20,431 of which are distributed across the 14 Mimulus chromosomes. We normalize libraries based on RNA composition with the calcNormFactors function, using the default trimmed mean of M-values method. To compare gene expression across the 24 samples in our data set, we used the plotMDS function in edgeR to generate a MDS plot, which is a type of unsupervised clustering plot (fig. 2). The distance between two points in an MDS plot represents the leading log-fold-change (i.e., largest absolute log-fold-change) between that sample pair. To test for differences in gene expression across the genotype-tissue groups, we conducted generalized linear model (GLM) analyses using a quasi-likelihood (QL) approach in edgeR. This method is flexible and permits any combination of sample comparisons to be made. First, we generated an experimental design matrix describing the eight genotype-tissue groups using the model.matrix function, then fitted it to a QL GLM framework using the glmQLFit function in edgeR. To identify genes with a log 2 fold-change > 1.25 between comparisons, we used the glmTreat function in edgeR, which performs threshold hypothesis testing on the GLM specified by the glmQLFit function. This is a rigorous statistical test that detects expression differences greater than the specified threshold value by evaluating both variance and magnitude of change in expression, then applies FDR P value corrections. We categorized genes as significantly differentially expressed between two groups if the log 2 FC > 1.25 and the FDR-corrected P value ≤ 0.05.We categorized gene expression in the STE and FER RSB7 individuals based on interspecific expression differences between IM62 and SF5, as well as differences between the RSB7 individual and its two parents (supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online). This resulted in eight expression categories: 1) Similar: the parents and RSB7 all have similar expression; 2) SF5-like (similar): RSB7 expression is similar to SF5 and significantly different than IM62. Expression does not differ between parents; 3) SF5-like (divergent): RSB7 expression is similar to SF5 and significantly different from IM62. Expression differs significantly between parents; 4) IM62-like (similar): RSB7 expression is similar to IM62 and significantly different from SF5. Expression does not differ between parents; 5) IM62-like (divergent): RSB7 expression is similar to IM62 and significantly different from SF5. Parents differ significantly; 6) Intermediate (divergent): RSB7 expression falls within the parental range. Expression differs significantly between parents; 7) Misexpressed (similar): RSB7 expression is higher or lower than both parents. Expression does not differ between parents; 8) Misexpressed (divergent): RSB7 expression is higher or lower than both parents. Expression differs significantly between parents.Allele-Specific Expression Analysis and Regulatory Divergence Category AssignmentBy comparing gene expression differences between species to allele-specific expression within interspecific hybrids, regulatory divergence can partitioned among contributing cis and trans components (Wittkopp et al. 2004). We utilized the allele-specific read counts to perform allele-specific expression analysis in edgeR (Robinson et al. 2010). To measure allele-specific expression bias in heterozygous genes within the introgression regions across STE and FER stamens and carpels, we compared proportions of reads that mapped to IM62 versus SF5 alleles. To limit our analyses to expressed genes, we eliminated genes with fewer than one allelic CPM in each genotype-tissue group. To test for bias in allele-specific expression across FER and STE tissues, we fitted our allele-specific count data to a GLM with the glmQLFit function, then performed QL ratio F-tests with the glmQLFTest function in edgeR. We categorized genes as having significant bias in allele-specific expression if the FDR-corrected P value ≤ 0.05.We quantified total (cis and trans) interspecific regulatory divergence across stamens and carpels as relative transcript abundance (log 2 fold-change) between SF5 and IM62 (pFC). Significant (FDR ≤ 0.05) differences in parental gene expression (i.e., significant pFC) were considered evidence of total (cis and trans) regulatory divergence. For the purpose of regulatory divergence categorization, pFC tests were performed using glmQLFTest function in edgeR, eliminating the log 2 fold-change > 1.25 threshold used for differential gene expression analysis. For heterozygous genes in the chromosome 6 and chromosome 11 introgressions, we were able to estimate cis-regulatory divergence as the relative abundance of allele-specific transcripts (log 2 fold-change) in the carpels and stamens of FER and STE introgression hybrids (aFC). A significant (FDR ≤ 0.05) imbalance in the ratio of SF5 versus IM62 alleles in the introgression hybrids (i.e., significant aFC) was considered evidence of cis-regulatory divergence. Genes with significant pFC or significant aFC were analyzed for significant trans effects by comparing pFC and aFC using Student’s t-test followed by FDR P value correction, implemented using the t.test and p.adjust functions in R (v3.6.1). Significant (FDR ≤ 0.05) differences between pFC and aFC were considered evidence for trans divergence. Genes with evidence of both cis- and trans-regulatory divergence were further categorized according to whether cis and trans effects acted in the same or opposite directions.We partitioned heterozygous FER and STE carpel and stamen genes into different regulatory divergence categories using the following rules (modeled after McManus et al. 2010; Mack et al. 2016): 1) cis only: pFC and aFC significant, trans not significant; 2) trans only: pFC significant, aFC not significant; 3) cis + trans: pFC, aFC, and trans significant; pFC and aFC have same sign (i.e., the species with higher expression contributes higher expressing cis-allele in hybrids); cis + trans was further divided into cis + trans reinforcing (magnitude of pFC is greater than aFC) and cis + trans opposing (magnitude of pFC is less than aFC); 4) cis × trans: pFC, aFC, and trans significant; pFC and aFC have opposite signs (i.e., the species with higher expression contributes lower expressing cis-allele in hybrids); 5) compensatory: pFC not significant, aFC and trans significant; 6) conserved: pFC and aFC not significant; and 7) ambiguous: any other combination of pFC, aFC, and trans (which have no clear interpretation).GO Enrichment AnalysisWe performed GO term enrichment analysis using the PlantRegMap online server (http://plantregmap.cbi.pku.edu.cn/index.php; last accessed January 19, 2020). To identify overrepresented GO terms within sets of differentially expressed genes, P value ≤ 0.01 was chosen as the significance threshold. We used the 20,431 genes expressed across the 14 Mimulus chromosomes as the background gene list for GO term enrichment analysis.

One Health was initiated as a concept [2], was upgraded to an approach [3,4] and is recently being considered as a movement [5]. It involves application of a coordinated, collaborative, multi-disciplinary and cross-sectoral approach to address potential or existing risks that originate at the animal-human-ecosystems interface [1,6]. It also encourages synergistic collaboration to achieve common public health goals. Collaboration requires a platform to engage multiple sectors and understand different health systems; it provides an opportunity to learn about health systems and its resilience [7]. The One Health approach cannot be operationalized without effective collaboration and facilitation among various actors within a complex health system. Therefore, exploring collaboration in One Health (including system resilience) is vital prior to implementing a countrywide One Health Collaboration (OHC) policies and strategies.Terms referring to collaboration for health have been employed ambiguously and interchangeably including but not limited to such terms as partnership, alliance, coalition, network, inter-organizational relationship, joint advocacy campaign, and taskforce [8]. The idea of intersectoral cooperation for health can be traced back to the Conference of Alma-Ata on Primary Health Care in 1978 and the movement it started when among others “agriculture, animal husbandry, food”, i.e. some of the main sectors in One Health, have been explicitly mentioned “as vital for improving the health and the well-being of the population” [9]. In 1997, a conference took up an Australian definition of intersectoral action or cooperation as: “a recognized relationship between part or parts of the health sector with part or parts of another sector, which has been formed to take action on an issue to achieve health outcome, in a way that is more effective, efficient or sustainable than could be achieved by the health sector acting alone” [10].Collaborations between the human and the animal health systems are not new. As early as 1984, American epidemiologist Calvin Schwabe proposed a unified human and veterinary approach against zoonotic diseases in “Veterinary Medicine and Human Health”, which is considered the origin of current One Health concepts [[11], [12], [13], [14], [15]]. However, collaboration in public health is a challenge at various levels of the health system [16,17] and it becomes more complex if OHC needs to be developed at a larger system level.1.1. Overview on health system and disease control mechanism of IndiaThere are multiple disease burdens such as burdens from the non-communicable diseases, maternal and child health problems, infectious diseases, re-emerging of diseases exists within the Indian health system [[18], [19], [20]]. It is challenging to respond to these burdens because of the nation's limited public health infrastructure and human resources, sociocultural diversity and rural-urban divide [21,22]. A mixed health care market of public and private providers is a reality in India, as the private sectors catered for two third services [23]. Because of limited access to the public sector, both the formal and informal private providers remain the main source for primary health care services in the country [22,24].Literature suggests that disease control mechanism in India is bi-phasic. The management of the human health system is shared between the central (federal) and state governments; while the Government of India is responsible for health policies, regulatory functions, and control of diseases and outbreaks. State governments are responsible for health care and training of personnel [25]. The apex body responsible for optimal health within country is Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoH&FW) that comprises of the Department of Health & Family Welfare and the Department of Health Research, but has no designated Department of Public Health. The Indian Government uses two strategies for control of infectious diseases.1.1.1.  Strategy 1 Vertical disease control programs, like Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme, National AIDS Control Programme, National Vector-Borne Diseases Control Programme etc. [26]. These programs are controlled by the Department of Health & Family Welfare, are virtually autonomous, each with its own central, state, and district officers, and field staff [26]. Although this approach helps to improve the management of programmes, it is too expensive to be replicated for the control of all other diseases [27,28]. Another critique of this mechanism is lack of integration between programs or with the health-care system at large. This restricts disease control to be effective, efficient and sustainable.1.1.2.  Strategy 2 Provision of ad-hoc assistance for outbreak investigations and control [29]. On invitation and/or request from respective Indian states, teams from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC, formerly known as National Institute of Communicable Diseases), a semi-autonomous institution that is controlled by the Directorate General of Health Services, provide technical and field based assistance [30]. In India usually, disease outbreaks are brought to the attention of program managers and community by the media, and they tend to sensationalize the outbreaks, whereas the state departments either tends to deny or underestimate the magnitude of the outbreak [31]. Further, this strategy also does not help control endemic infectious diseases, irrespective of the magnitude. Some major milestones for controlling infectious diseases in India were: the execution of the Epidemic Disease Act of 1897, initiation of National Surveillance Programme on Communicable Diseases in 1997 and the launching of the Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) in 2004 [29]. IDSP currently captures syndromic, probable and laboratory-confirmed cases. It also predicts disease trends through its state and district surveillance units [32].Animal health is a subject of the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying (AH&D), now renamed as Department of Animal Husbandry Dairying & Fisheries (DADF) under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare (MoA&FW). In each district of each state, there are offices of a deputy director of animal husbandry or assistant director animal husbandry, which direct institutions such as veterinary dispensaries, branch veterinary dispensaries, mobile veterinary dispensaries and first aid veterinary centers. They not only provide disease specific diagnostic services and treatment to livestock but also implement various individual beneficiary schemes. As per the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), the central government is responsible for animal disease surveillance [33]. There are two key surveillance systems for animal health functional now in the country i.e. National Animal Disease Reporting System (NADRS) and another by National Institute of Veterinary Epidemiology and Disease Informatics (NIVEDI) [34,35]. NADRS aims to record and monitor livestock disease situation in the country with a view to initiate preventive and curative action on the basis of outbreaks reported [34]; whereas NIVEDI is a weather based animal disease forecasting surveillance system [35]. About 143 animal diseases are currently reported as per the Prevention and Control of Infectious and Contagious Diseases in Animals Act, 2009 [36].1.2. Missing link between the human and animal healthIndia has documented several large outbreaks in the last decades, with a high burden of zoonotic diseases [37]. While Bangladesh has started a ‘One Health’ policy and Nepal is working towards it, India does not have the same in place yet, despite facing a greater burden of zoonotic diseases. India's response has by far been reactive, jumping from one outbreak to the next [[37], [38], [39], [40]]. Though the essence of One Health has been well understood not only from the veterinary perspective [41] but also from the human health perspective [42], the actions are largely limited to few collaborative strategies. There are few collaborative models tried at pan-India level for delivering equitable health services or for making the health system more resilient [43,44]. To fil this gap, this review focuses on the global OHC strategies and discusses which type of collaboration might work for the health system of India. 2. MethodThe present review was conducted as per the PRISMA guidelines (Fig. 1) [45] in the following three steps:▪ Step One: Identification of key collaboration strategies that are discussed in One Health▪ Step Two: Identification of global OHC strategies or initiatives through seminal articles and reports that are pertinent to country specific collaboration▪ Step Three: Identification of One Health initiatives in IndiaOpen in a separate windowFig. 1PRISMA Chart showing the reviewed seminal articles/reports for the country-specific collaboration strategies and/or initiatives.We used PubMed and Web of Science databases for this review. We accessed national and international websites looking for reports and documents on OHC and initiatives. To include all possible evidences of collaboration, the exclusion and inclusion criteria for the papers were kept flexible and conducted without any time frame. Only studies published in the English language were included in the review. Studies producing a new viewpoint on how human health could collaborate with other sectors for control of zoonotic diseases were also included for the review. Studies that had assessed the knowledge gap among these professionals on zoonoses risk and management or teamwork communication within the respective profession were excluded. Studies not discussing the strategies for collaboration were excluded from the review. The scope of the review was increased based on findings from the review of key papers and reports. We restricted our search boundary to the prevention and control of zoonoses within the domain of One Health and available collaboration strategies. Relevant published and unpublished technical documents were accessed for review. The search terms used were: (“collaboration” OR “joint effort” OR “partnership” OR “interprofession*” OR “interdisciplin*” OR “interoccupation*” OR “interinstitution*” OR “interdepartment*” OR “interorganization*” OR “multiprofession*” OR “multidisciplin*” OR “multioccupation*” OR “multiorganisation*” OR “multigorganization*” OR “intersector*” OR “multisector*”) AND (“public health” OR “human health” OR “animal health” OR “animal husbandry” OR “physician” OR “veterinary*” OR “health system”). 3. Results3.1. Key OHC strategies and/ or initiativesBased on the first search, we found three different key collaboration strategies that have been discussed for One Health, as mentioned in Table 1.Table 1Summary of key .collaboration strategies for One HealthAuthor, yearKey collaboration strategyKey findingsKahn, [46]Level-based collaborationIndividual-level collaborations, population-level collaborations, and comparative medicine research collaborations are the potential levels of collaboration between human and animal health systems.Zinsstag et al., [47]Solution-based collaborationSolution-based collaboration is emphasized with combined immunization program including economic savings from the integration of animal and human health systems.Anholt et al., [48]Third-party-based collaborationA third party based collaboration that can act as a knowledgeable and trusted intermediary between the human and the animal health systems.Open in a separate windowKahn [46] emphasized level-based collaboration• at the individual level: collaboration between the physicians and the veterinarians for individual health in assessing the zoonotic disease risk and early detection• at the population level: collaborations during outbreaks between the human and animal health systems• at the research level: collaboration between human and animal research institutes forms a new potential to gain new scientific insights into agent-host interactions.It is clear from the viewpoint of the author, that there is the possibility of level-based collaboration for various strategies.Zinsstag et al. [47] discussed solution-based collaboration, which requires both human and animal health system actors to collaborate for a specific purpose. One of the examples mentioned is the integration of health services, such as a joint vaccination program in Chad, where a trial was successfully conducted among pastoralists' women, children and cattle. Further, the authors explained that laboratory collaborations for diagnostic data sharing are much easier than establishing the communication between public health and veterinary authorities. The authors argue that health system reform towards the One Health approach should be solution-oriented.Anholt et al. [48] discussed third-party-based collaboration, where a third party acts as knowledge broker between the human and animal health professionals. The authors believe that, there is a potential role for centralized agencies, government and not-for-profit organizations as third-party knowledge brokers to facilitate OHC.3.2. Global OHC strategies and/or initiativesBased on the second search, 25 initiatives for collaboration were identified across the globe.

Level-based collaboration Individual level-based collaboration that is, between human and animal health practitioners that is practiced in Tanzania [49]. Also in developed nations (such as the United States or Europe) there are some efforts to integrate these professionals through combined education [50,51]. There are also unique initiatives in East African countries for strengthening the clinical knowledge of these professionals through two years of field epidemiology training [52,53]. The MSc in One Health Analytical Epidemiology course in Zambia aims to create a cadre of epidemiologists with a broad understanding of disease control and prevention. Those who complete this course will be able to conceptualize and design holistic programs for informing health and disease control policy decisions [53]. The feasibility of such initiative is also supported by findings from Thailand, where field epidemiologist-veterinarians are promoted [54]. A unique way of collaboration identified in the United States is through the development of One Health clinics, which were established using an interdisciplinary approach to individual and community health, where both human and animal health services are combined together for targeted communities [55].Most of the population-based strategies identified are surveillance-based. There are various attempts to integrate the human and animal health surveillance across the global south as well as in developed nations. For example disease-specific surveillance such as of arbovirus in Serbia [56], Campylobacter in Switzerland [57], antibiotic resistance in Vietnam [58] and system-based geo-spatial and clinical data capture in Africa [59].There are examples of various research institutes collaborating for the development of the OHC. Two examples for developing skills and interdisciplinary training are from the South East Asian Network [60] and Egypt [61]. These initiatives are mostly at the academic institution level in the form of funding activities. A unique research-based collaboration was developed between the zoo and the public health institutes in Kenya and United States [62] for conducting various zoonotic researches.3.2.2.  Solution-based collaboration These collaborations are geared towards specific diseases or for overcoming outbreak conditions. Two examples are managing the H7N9 outbreak in China [63] and disrupt the sleeping sickness in Uganda [64]. Initially in China, the human and the animal authorities managed the H7N9 outbreaks separately, until the evidence gathered proved that poultry were the original source of the virus. It took about five years for the agricultural departments and public health departments to turn from reserved collaboration to reinforced collaboration to prevent the further spread of H7N9 in China, where the collaborative preventive measures were implemented in poultry [63]. Similarly in Uganda, the mass treatment to destroy the trypanosomes in the cattle population was initiated primarily through research and scaled-up to larger population [64]. There is evidence that developing multi-sectoral strategies also solved some other One Health issues, such as controlling leptospirosis in Fiji [65] and managing pathogenic E. coli in Latin America [66]. The latter strategies have been developed within the research group, which also signifies the level-based research collaboration in addition to the solution-based collaboration.To overcome the shortage of veterinarians, two unique initiatives were made; one in the Republic of Chad, where a combined immunization program was conducted [67] and another in Sierra Leone, where Animal Health Clubs were initiated to strengthen the local capacity [68].3.2.3.  Third-party-based collaboration A third-party or intermediary knowledge broker leads this type of collaboration. The intermediary unit or secretariat leads OHC by overcoming the barriers among all the engaged stakeholders. A classic example is from Kenya, where a One Health coordinating unit under the Zoonotic Disease Unit was established to develop the One Health approach [69]. This unit bridges the animal and human health sectors by deploying a senior epidemiologist from each ministry in order to maintain collaboration at the animal and human health interface towards better prevention and control of zoonoses. In addition, an ecologist was added to the unit to ensure that environmental risks are adequately addressed in emerging disease control [69].Similar efforts have been made in Mongolia. Guided by the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases, Mongolia has established a functional coordination mechanism between the animal and human health sectors. With the four pillars of zoonoses framework i.e. surveillance, information exchange and risk assessment, risk reduction, coordinated response capacity and collaborative research, it established the OHC in the country [70].Bangladesh has formulated a One Health secretariat by providing an additive administrative power to this inter-ministerial taskforce for developing a strategic One Health framework and action plans for the country [71].3.3. Indian OHC strategies and/or initiativesThere are a few instances of collaboration in India for the control of outbreaks [[37], [38], [39], [40]]. The initiatives that have been commenced so far in India are either solution-based collaborations or level-based (research) collaborations.Institutions like ICMR and ICAR collaborated for joint research priorities [72], whereas RCZI was formulated in PHFI for zoonotic research [73], which signifies the level-based (research) collaboration initiatives in the country. Similarly, there are few examples of solution-based approaches, such as the national influenza pandemic committee to control avian influenza [74] and leptospirosis [75].A unique state-specific level-based collaboration strategy was developed for controlling rabies in the state of Tamil Nadu [76]. The strategy adapted in Tamil Nadu involved triangulating the dog bite surveillance data with vaccine consumption and dog population to find out the trend at the district and state level. Further the activities were conducted by separate departments at various levels and all the departments were linked with similar and specific objectives.Another recent initiative that signifies the role of a third party is by Department of Biotechnology (DBT) under the Ministry of Science and Technology, who has proposed to have a One Health roadmap for India with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The details of the initiatives have been shown in Table 3.Table 3Review of One Health collaboration strategies and/or initiatives in India.Type of collaborationType of initiativeCollaborative partnersCriticism of the collaborationSolution-basedNSCZ [93]MoHFWLack of ownership of other ministries and uncertainty on the policy/ guidelines.Level-based (Research)ICMR-ICAR Collaboration [72]ICMR and ICARUnclear guidelines on identifying the prioritized research sectors for common funding.Solution-basedNIP Committee [74]NICD-MoHFW & DAH-MoAFWDisease-specific and only for pandemic duration.

There are certain health system shortcomings highlighted in the literature such as lack of awareness, lack of access, human resource crisis, affordability, lack of accountability [18,19,77]. These challenges that also have an impact on One Health issues can be overcome through a sustainable collaboration, which is one among other potential solution [78]. Several global OHC initiatives are considered in this review. These might be potential approaches to be adapted to the Indian context. However, as there is no documented evaluation of these types of collaborations, it is very difficult to speculate which of these will help to develop a resilient Indian health system, capable of adapting the One Health approach. Further, there is no one-size-fits-all health system; therefore specific local strategies need to be developed for the Indian context.Considering the available global OHCs, currently India is into the level-based (research) and solution-based collaboration. For continuity of One Health research in India, level-based (research) collaborations like ICMR-ICAR/RCZI need to be strengthened further in terms of financing, staff, material, resources and political support.An outbreak control mechanism (solution-based) is generally robust, having been planned at the central and state level and implemented at the grassroots level; however, this needs to be sustained in the post-outbreak era for early detection and prevention. For example, although the initiative in Tamil Nadu for rabies control is by far the ideal model of population and individual-based collaboration at different levels of the system in the country, the sustainability of this model may be a challenge. After the research funding ends, the system should be resilient enough to continue with the collaborative strategies. Further, the vertical disease control mechanism need to be improved to capture multiple diseases; for these functions, the system needs to be corroborated.There is a scope for two types of collaboration to be integrated in the Indian health system. One, the third party based i.e. recent initiatives by Department of Biotechnology, has a potential to coordinate all the ministries required for One Health. Second, level-based collaborations especially at the provider level. For example, the establishment of One Health clinics, at least in the areas of high human-animal density [55], or the joint One Health training programs [[50], [51], [52], [53]] for workers from both systems need to be incorporated into the health system of the country. In addition, due to lack of human resources and budgetary constraints, it will be worthwhile to initiate combined delivery of health services at least in the hard-to-reach areas of the country. Though there is some sort of solution-based and level (research) based collaboration are already in the place; the future for the India would be forming a combination of third-party and level-based composite collaboration for strengthening the health system.4.1. Way forward: envisaged OHC strategies for the Indian health systemConvening joint political discussions or acting only during outbreaks, at times of emergency or crisis is not sufficient to yield successful results [79]. Ongoing dialogue and continuous action is necessary for a sustainable collaboration across the health system. Based on documented global initiatives and considering the health system of India, the envisaged One Health strategies for the Indian health system is presented below. It aims to develop a composite collaboration with a combination of third-party and level-based collaboration:4.1.1.  Level-based (individual) collaboration The level (individual) based collaboration can be of two types: strengthening One Health education and improving One Health practices.Incorporating One Health into university education [80] as well as engaging in interdisciplinary teaching [81,82] can foster collaboration at the individual level in the long-term. The learnings from developing a One Health module in African states [49,52], Europe [51], USA [50] can be considered for the Indian scenario. One way is to develop an integrated One Health module by engaging professional bodies such as the Indian Medical Association and the Indian Veterinary Association.Initiatives such as field epidemiology from Zambia [53] and Thailand [54], with strengthened clinical aspects can be integrated into the training and education of Indian system. The current field epidemiology run by NCDC should make an effort to involve animal health experts and could be designated as One Health Field Epidemiology Program.In Australia, at the practitioner-level, there is a systematic case-referral mechanism, especially between the physicians and the veterinarians for early detection of disease. This should be emulated in India. [83]. Patients, if given a chance, are interested in consulting specialists from both fields; this needs to be realized in the Indian setting too. Initiatives like public-private partnerships [84] need to be considered for developing such types of collaborations at a system level, with a structured framework and with specific goals [85].One Health Clinics are in place in USA [55] and can be adapted to the Indian system. One strategy could be the recent initiative of providing comprehensive primary care through Health & Wellness Centers. These centers have the potential to be developed into One Health Centers [86]. Thus, the future can be envisaged as One Health & Wellness Center at the grass-root level addressing all preventive and promotive aspects.4.1.2.  Level-based (population) collaboration The level (population) based collaboration strategies are essential to develop One Health surveillance. In this review, two types of One Health surveillance are documented:• disease-specific surveillance such as of arbovirus in Serbia [56], Campylobacter in Switzerland [57] and antibiotic resistance in Vietnam [58]• System-based geo-spatial and clinical data capture as in Africa [59].Though both human disease (IDSP) and animal disease (NADRS) surveillances are in place in India, it is essential to develop strategies to integrate these two-surveillance systems and prepare a roadmap for One Health surveillance in the country. To enhance multi-sectoral coordination, recently a veterinarian has been recruited in the IDSP for looking into the One Health aspect [87]. This is a welcome initiative and needs to be strengthened at the district and sub-district level for early prediction of outbreaks.4.1.3.  Level-based (research) collaboration Research approaches to address complex health issues at the animal–human–ecosystem interface is on the global agenda for implementing OHC [88]. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have so far been independent and discipline oriented. Therefore research initiatives from the viewpoint of One Health need to be promoted [89], which is already in place in South East Asia [60]. Evidence-based decision-making and transformation of observations into narratives detailing how situations emerge and might unfold in the future can be achieved by system thinking or participatory epidemiology research [59,90]. Finally, trans-disciplinary approaches can be used both to improve the effectiveness of existing systems and to develop novel networks for collective action [91]. Efforts such as ICMR-ICAR collaboration need to be scaled up and should reach the local-level medical university-agriculture university collaboration for joint research. The zoo and public health research collaboration as in Kenya can also be adapted to the Indian setting [62].4.1.4.  Third-party-based (Inter-ministerial One Health task force) collaboration Initiatives like the One Health Secretariat and the One Health strategic framework in Bangladesh might constitute the learning framework for India [71]. The recent effort by Department of Biotechnology under the Ministry of Science and Technology can act as an inter-ministerial One Health task force. If it succeeds, all the essential ministries can be brought under its umbrella. This can become part of the current One Health roadmap for India. It should focus on integrated surveillance, developing collaboration at the practitioner level and research aspects. An envisaged OHC model considering the Indian health system is shown in Fig. 2.Open in a separate windowFig. 2Envisaged One Health Collaboration model for India.Many experts voice that India must have a One Health policy with specific focus on OHC [38,39]. Thus far, inter-sectoral mechanisms aimed at operationalising One Health appear to currently be a set of uncoordinated ad-hoc efforts. Further, collaboration in India should not be restricted to the country; ideally to reduce threats and strengthen global health security, India should seek global scientific collaboration.Although this review compiles global One Health initiatives on collaboration strategies based on a methodologically sound search, we understand that there must have been more efforts that have not been captured through this review. As we only screened the publications with titles and the key words referring to terms connected to One Health and collaboration, there is always a chance that reports and articles that do not use those terms, but have relevant content might have not been included in this review. 5. ConclusionPresent review found that collaborations in the domain of One Health are mainly of three types:• level-based collaboration (individual, population or research),• solution-based collaboration• third party based collaboration.Although, many initiatives are being undertaken globally for disease prevention and control from the viewpoint of One Health; however, in India, solution-based approaches during emergencies and outbreaks and some sort of level-based collaborations are in place. It is high time to develop a sustainable level-based collaboration that integrates with third-party based collaboration with in larger domain of One Health. As there is no one-size-fits-all approach for developing OHC between various actors of the health system, it is necessary, before any collaboration approach, to gain a deep understanding of the local needs and chances for collaboration. A composite collaboration with a combination of third-party (inter-ministerial One Health task force) and level-based collaborations comprising individual (among the clinicians and through the One Health module in education and training), population (integrated surveillance), research (One Health integrated), will lead to a more resilient Indian health system. In addition, there is a need for further studies on the system and contextual factors responsible for OHC strategies prior to their implementation.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/32823493/,"1. IntroductionFluorescence immunochromatographic assay (FICA) is a common point-of-care testing (POCT) technique [1], wherein fluorescent particles are used to label antibodies and analyte concentration is quantitatively detected by analyzing the fluorescence intensity of a test strip [2,3]. Given its advantages of high stability, sensitivity, and low interference by natural fluorescence, FICA has been widely used in food safety [4], clinical diagnosis [5], and environmental monitoring [6].With the rapid development of POCT in recent years, the development of FICA strip readers has been directed toward miniaturization, mobility, and intelligence [7]. The photoelectric scanning method or the image analysis method is mainly adopted in existing FICA strip readers. A photoelectric FICA strip reader uses a stepping motor to drive a photoelectric receiver to scan a test strip, and quantitative detection is performed by analyzing the variation rule of the analog electrical signal output by the photoelectric receiver. At present, most FICA strip readers are based on the photoelectric scanning method [8,9,10]. Although these readers have high accuracy and stability, the position of a test strip must be located before detection. Numerous works on the follow-up maintenance and debugging of photoelectric FICA strip readers for test strips of different sizes have been conducted. An image FICA strip reader uses an image sensor to collect strip images, and extracts the characteristic values of test strips through image segmentation and image processing [11,12]. In contrast to a photoelectric FICA strip reader, an image FICA strip reader lacks a stepper motor and analog signal processing circuit, and thus has the advantages of simple structure and small size. However, expensive high-performance complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors are often used to improve the detection precision of image FICA strip readers. Therefore, the use of high-performance CMOS image sensors increases overall costs.Smartphones have evolved from simple communication tools into smart terminals that integrate multiple functions. They have the advantages of portability, powerful computing performance, and convenient data transmission. Above all, they are the largest application field of CMOS image sensors. There has been much research on quantitative detection based on smartphones. For instance, Jing Wu et al. [13] developed a magnetic lateral flow strip based on magnetic beads and smartphone camera, which converts the color density of the magnetic beads into gray values through image processing, to achieve quantitative detection of cocaine in urine samples. Considering that current smartphones are equipped with CMOS image sensors, and identifying user information and obtaining scale curves by scanning two-dimensional codes on test strips are easy, an image FICA strip reader based on smartphones was developed in this work. The smartphone-based FICA strip reader, which contains an optical module that is suitable for test strips with different fluorescent markers and uses an android smartphone to perform image acquisition, image processing, and characteristic value extraction, has high portability, versatility, and accuracy. 2. Development of the Proposed FICA Strip Reader2.1. Principle of Quantitative DetectionFICA is a membrane detection technique for quantitative analysis [14,15]. The double-antibody sandwich immunochromatographic assay (ICA) is generally adopted when detecting macromolecular antigens with multiple antigenic determinants (proteins, viruses, and pathogenic bacteria). When the concentration of the analyte is higher, the more fluorescent particles are enriched on the T line, so the fluorescence intensity of the T line is stronger. However, the fluorescent intensity of the C line used to verify the validity of the test strip is unchanged, so the characteristic value of the test strip is larger. Competitive ICA is generally adopted when detecting micromolecule haptens with single antigenic epitopes (toxins or drug residues). When the concentration of the analyte is higher, the fewer fluorescent particles are enriched on the T line due to competitive inhibition, so the fluorescence intensity of the T line is weaker; the more fluorescent particles are enriched on the C line, so the fluorescence intensity of the C line is strong. Therefore, the characteristic value of the test strip is smaller.Although the quantitative detection methods for different analytes are different, both the double-antibody sandwich ICA for the detection of macromolecular antigens and the competitive ICA for detection of micromolecule haptens can be realized in the test strip. For instance, Fan Yang et al. [16] developed a double-antibody sandwich ICA test strip for the rapid detection of H9 subtype of avian influenza viruses’ antibodies. Guanghua Li et al. [17] developed a competitive ICA test strip that can be used for the simultaneous detection of aflatoxin M1 and melamine in milk. For test strips prepared via double-antibody sandwich ICA, high antigen concentrations in test solutions are associated with bright test lines (T lines) and control lines (C lines) with unchanged brightness. For test strips prepared via competitive ICA, high antigen concentrations in test solution are associated with bright C lies and faded T lines.Under illumination by an excitation light source, the fluorescence intensity of the T and C lines of a test strip is linearly related to the concentration of fluorescent particles on the T and C lines [12]. During testing, the ratio of the gray value of the T line to C line is equal to the ratio of the fluorescence intensity of the T line to the C line [18]. The T and C lines of the same test strip are labeled with the same fluorescent marker. Thus, the characteristic value (t) of the test strip is given by: t=cTcC=IfTIfC=HTHC(1) where cT and cC represent the concentration of the fluorescent particles on the T and C lines, respectively; IfT and IfC represent the fluorescence intensity of the T and C lines, respectively; and HT and HC represent the gray value of the T and C lines, respectively. Therefore, for the image analysis method, the characteristic value of the test strip can be obtained by calculating the ratio of the gray value of the T line to the C line.2.2. Development of the Optical ModuleA single excitation light source was adopted in the design scheme, to ensure the uniformity of the light intensity of the excitation light source, and facilitate subsequent image processing. The light path should be increased through the method of light reflection to expand the illumination range of a single light-emitting diode (LED). In this work, the reflective surface of aluminum foil tape was used as the reflective material, and the back gum of the tape was easily pasted on an optical module. Aluminum foil has an ultraviolet (UV) light reflectivity of approximately 80%, and a small amount of diffuse reflection. After the excitation light was emitted by the LED, it was reflected by the aluminum foil to the observation window of the test strip. It finally reached the camera of the mobile phone through a light filter and a macro lens.The interference of external light must be eliminated, and the whole optical system should be as closed as possible, to ensure the consistency of the test environment. The optical module was constructed from light-cured acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic by using a 3D printer, and opaque materials were pasted around and in the bottom plate to isolate external light. The thickness of the outer shell and the partition of the optical module was 2 mm, and the sites where the accessories were installed were thickened and strengthened as needed.The optical module was powered by universal serial bus, and provided a stable excitation current to the LED through a constant-current source module. Its excitation light source and light filter could be selected in accordance with the excitation and emission spectra of the fluorescent particles for compatibility with the test strips with different fluorescent markers. In general, the minimum clear imaging distance of smartphones is between 6.5 and 7.5 cm. A 15-fold macro lens, which could reduce the minimum clear imaging distance of the smartphones to approximately 3 cm, and enable the clear shooting of objects at close range, was installed at the viewfinder, to reduce the size of the optical module. Under the condition that the mobile phone could focus accurately, the size of the optical module should be minimized to facilitate transport. The overall size of the optical module was 115 mm long, 70 mm wide, and 45 mm high. The design process of the optical module is shown in Figure 1.Open in a separate windowFigure 1(a) Design diagram of the optical module; (b) Optical path of the optical module; (c) Physical diagram of the optical module.2.3. Image Processing and Characteristic Value ExtractionCompared with computers, smartphones have poorer computing power and more roles during use. Therefore, the software algorithm should be designed to minimize the occupation of system resources, to improve software running speed. The sliding window algorithm, instead of the clustering algorithm used by computers to process strip images, was used in the recognition of the T and C lines of the strip image, as shown in Figure 2.Open in a separate windowFigure 2Schematic of sliding window detection.If a valid sample image is obtained when the program is run, the image of the observation window of the test strip is first intercepted, and then image processing is performed. This approach not only greatly reduces the calculation amount of the smartphone, but also increases program speed. Then, the image of the observation window of the test strip is separated into two areas with the same sizes on the left and right, and two rectangular windows with the same size (i × j) are used as the sliding window. The effect of the sliding window size on the calculation of the characteristic value is shown in the detection of the standard strip images in Section 3.1. Two sequences, namely, {Hx}, {Hy}, can be obtained by calculating the gray value of each position in the sliding process of each sliding window.The gray value of the sliding window on the left side is: Hx=∑xx+i∑0jh(x,j)(2) The gray value of the sliding window on the right side is: Hy=∑yy+i∑0jh(y,j)(3) where x is the horizontal coordinate of the left side, y is the horizontal coordinate of the right side, and h(x, j) is the gray value of point (x, j). The brightest parts on the left and right sides correspond to the T and C lines of the test strip, respectively. Thus, the gray values of the T and C lines are given by: Hc=max{Hx}(4) HT=max{Hy}(5) Substituting (4) and (5) into (1) yields t=HTHC=max{Hy}max{Hx}(6) Although a light filter was installed in front of the macro lens, some fluorescent particles remained in the background area of the test strip, due to the insufficient chromatographic assay during the reaction. Therefore, the interference of the background gray value should be subtracted when calculating the gray values of the T and C lines. If the gray value of the background area is HB, then the calculation formula of the characteristic value is given by: t=HT−HBHC−HB=max{Hy}−HBmax{Hx}−HB(7) When using double-antibody sandwich ICA for the quantitative detection of an analyte, such as human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG), high analyte concentration is associated with the high gray value of the T line, and the gray value of the C line remains unchanged. Therefore, the characteristic value of the test strip is positively correlated with the concentration of the analyte. When using competitive ICA for the quantitative detection of an analyte, such as aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), high analyte concentration is associated with the small gray value of the T line and the large gray value of the C line. Therefore, the characteristic value of the test strip is negatively correlated with the concentration of the analyte.For adaption to test strips of different sizes, a calibration program for the screenshot frame was set in the software. This program could calibrate the size and position of the screenshot frame, in accordance with the actual position of observation window of the test strip in the optical module. The actual test showed that the T and C lines of the test strip were evenly distributed in the vertical direction, and the site outside the observation window was the background. Therefore, when the size of the screenshot frame was slightly smaller than the observation window of the test strip, the manual difference of the calibration operation had a negligible effect on the accuracy of the quantitative detection. The steps of image processing were as follows: (1)When the original image is collected, the android smartphone reads the calibration parameters of the screenshot frame and writes them into the screenshot function. Then, the strip image is cut to obtain the image of the observation window of the test strip.(2)The filter function of the OpenCV computer vision library is used to reduce the noise, which is caused by the interference of environment light, sensor temperature, light source, and other factors during collection and transmission, of the strip image.(3)The processed image is divided into two equal left-hand and right-hand areas, and two rectangular sliding windows of the same size are established. The two sliding windows traverse their respective regions, with one pixel as the step length. The maximum gray value of the window coverage in their respective areas is calculated.(4)The gray value when the sliding window is horizontally centered is taken as the background gray value. The maximum gray value obtained for the sliding window in the left-hand and right-hand areas is subtracted from the background gray value, and then the ratio of the two difference values is taken as the characteristic value of the strip image.  3. Experiment3.1. Detection of Standard Strip ImagesThe standard strip images shown in Figure 3a were used for performance verification in this work, to verify the effect of the proposed FICA strip reader on image processing and the characteristic value extraction of the test strip. The smartphone-based FICA strip reader could accurately recognize the positions of the T and C lines of the test strip in the detection of the standard strip images.Open in a separate windowFigure 3(a) Standard strip images; (b) Test results of the standard strip images.As found in the actual test, the T and C lines were approximately 60 pixels in width. Therefore, the characteristic values of each strip with the width of the sliding window within the range of 20–60 pixels were calculated at 20-pixel intervals. The test results are shown in Figure 3b. The calculated characteristic values of each test strip under different sliding window widths were very close. Therefore, when the width of the sliding window was smaller than the widths of the T and C lines, the change in the width of the sliding window had little effect on the detection results.3.2. Quantitative Detection of HCG Rare elements were used as the fluorescent marker in the HCG test strip (Triplex International Biosciences Co., LTD., Xiamen, China) in this experiment, and their excitation and emission spectra are shown in Figure 4. The UV LED model UVTOP335TO39HS with the peak light emission wavelength of 340 nm was selected as the excitation light source of the HCG test strip, and a light filter with 610 nm wavelength was installed in front of the macro lens.Open in a separate windowFigure 4Excitation and emission spectra of the human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) test strip.3.2.1. Detection of HCG Test StripsA part of HCG test strips and the collected images in the experiment were shown in Figure 5. The brightness of T line, C line and background area in the observation window of fluorescent test strip was uniform.Open in a separate windowFigure 5HCG test strips and collected images.3.2.2. Curve FittingThe proposed FICA strip reader was used to detect HCG solutions with 9 different concentrations (10, 25, 50, 125, 250, 500, 1250, 2500, and 5000 mIU/mL). HCG solutions were prepared by diluting HCG powder (TanMo Quality Testing Technology Co., LTD., Beijing, China) with deionized water. The test strip of each concentration was tested 6 times, and the average value of the test results was taken as the characteristic value. The least square method was used for curve fitting, to obtain the relationship between the concentration of the HCG solution and the characteristic value of the HCG test trip detected by the proposed FICA strip reader. This relationship is: t=0.132ln(c)+0.120(8) where c is the concentration of the HCG solution, and t is the characteristic value of the HCG test strip detected by the proposed FICA strip reader. As can be seen from Figure 6, a linear detection range from 10 to 5000 mIU/mL (R2 = 0.95) was obtained. The limit of detection (LoD) was 4.7 mIU/mL with 3δ/slope calculation. Compared with the optical inspection system for HCG detection based on the Taguchi method proposed in reference [19], which has a linear range of 6.25–50.00 mIU/mL (R2 = 0.99) and a detection limit of 6.25 mIU/mL, our FICA strip reader has a wider application range, due to its wider linear detection range.Open in a separate windowFigure 6Relationship between the concentration of HCG and characteristic value.3.2.3. Accuracy TestThe proposed FICA strip reader was used to detect HCG solutions with 5 different concentrations (25, 50, 500, 2500, and 5000 mIU/mL). By substituting the characteristic value t of the test strip image detected by the proposed FICA strip reader into (8), HCG concentration, recovery rate, and relative error could be calculated. The experimental data are shown in Table 1.Table 1Test results for HCG.Concentration (mIU/mL)Characteristic ValueCalculated Concentration (mIU/mL)Recovery RateRelative Error250.54725.532102.13%2.13%500.62345.46890.94%9.06%5000.935485.91397.18%2.82%25001.1612702.818108.11%8.11%50001.2294529.53790.59%9.41%Open in a separate windowThe test results in the above table showed that the relative error of the test result for the 5000 mIU/mL HCG solution was the largest (9.41%). This result indicated that the smartphone-based FICA strip reader had high accuracy in the quantitative detection of HCG solutions.3.3. Quantitative Detection of AFB1 In this experiment, phycocyanin was used as the fluorescent marker in the AFB1 test strip (laboratory self-made), and its excitation and emission spectra are shown in Figure 7. The LED model UVTOP335TO39HS with the peak light emission wavelength of 555 nm was selected as the excitation light source of the AFB1 test strip, and a light filter with a wavelength of 640 nm was installed in front of the macro lens.Open in a separate windowFigure 7Excitation and emission spectra of the aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) test strip.3.3.1. Detection of AFB1 Test StripsA part of AFB1 test strips and the collected images in the experiment were shown in Figure 8. The brightness of T line, C line and background area in the observation window of fluorescent test strip was uniform.Open in a separate windowFigure 8AFB1 test strips and collected images.3.3.2. Curve FittingThe proposed FICA strip reader was used to detect AFB1 solutions with 9 different concentrations (5, 50, 100, 250, 600, 800, 1000, 2000, and 4000 pg/mL). AFB1 solutions were prepared by diluting AFB1 powder (Shanghai Yuduo Biotechnology Co., LTD., Shanghai, China) with deionized water. The test strip of each concentration was tested 6 times, and the average value of the test results was taken as the characteristic value. The least square method was used for curve fitting, to obtain the relationship between the concentration of the AFB1 solution and the characteristic value of the AFB1 test trip detected by the proposed FICA strip reader. This relationship is: t=−0.401ln(c)+3.328(9) where c is the concentration of the AFB1 solution, and t is the characteristic value of the AFB1 test strip detected by the proposed FICA strip reader. As can be seen from Figure 9, a linear detection range from 5 to 4000 pg/mL (R2 = 0.99) was obtained. The LoD was 3.9 pg/mL with 3δ/slope calculation. Compared with the smartphone-based fluorimetric sensor system for AFB1 detection proposed in reference [20], which has a linear range of 20–100 ng/mL (R2 = 0.98), and a detection limit of 20 ng/mL, our FICA strip reader has a wider application range due to its lower LoD.Open in a separate windowFigure 9Relationship between the concentration of AFB1 and characteristic value.3.3.3. Accuracy TestThe proposed FICA strip reader was used to detect AFB1 solutions with 5 different concentrations (25, 75, 500, 1000, and 2000 pg/mL). AFB1 concentration, recovery rate, and relative error could be calculated by substituting the characteristic value t of the test strip image detected by the proposed FICA strip reader into (9). The experimental data are shown in Table 2.Table 2Test results for AFB1.Concentration (pg/mL)Characteristic ValueCalculated Concentration (pg/mL)Recovery RateRelative Error252.06923.09692.38%7.62%751.58577.218102.96%2.96%2500.999278.572111.43%11.43%10000.5101127.132112.71%12.71%20000.2702050.697102.53%2.53%Open in a separate windowThe test results in the above table showed that the relative error of the test result for 1000 pg/mL AFB1 solution was the largest (12.71%). This result showed that the smartphone-based FICA strip reader had high accuracy in the quantitative detection of AFB1 solutions. 4. ConclusionsWith the popularization of smartphones, detection devices based on smartphones have shown the advantages of portability, easy operation, and low cost. These characteristics are in line with the development trend of POCT. By analyzing the shortcomings of current FICA strip readers, this work developed a smartphone-based FICA strip reader.The proposed FICA strip reader consisted of an optical module and an android smartphone. The optical module used the reflective light of a single LED to improve the uniformity of the light source and facilitated subsequent image processing. The excitation light source and the filter could be replaced in accordance with the characteristics of the fluorescent particles. The use of a macro lens shortened the minimum clear imaging distance, and reduced the size of the optical module. The smartphone was used for image collection and image processing and for the characteristic value extraction of the test strip. The sliding window algorithm was used to recognize the T and C lines of the test strip. This approach reduced the occupation of system resources and increased the speed of the software. In the quantitative detection of HCG, the linear detection range was 10 to 5000 mIU/mL (R2 = 0.95), with the maximum relative error less than 9.41%, and the LoD of the test strip for HCG was 4.7 mIU/mL. In the quantitative detection of AFB1, the linear detection range was 5 to 4000 pg/mL (R2 = 0.99), with the maximum relative error less than 12.71%, and the LoD of the test strip for AFB1 being 3.9 pg/mL. The smartphone-based FICA strip reader has broad application prospects in POCT, given its high portability, versatility, and accuracy.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/31266939/,"AbstractThe functionalities of the untethered miniature swimming robots significantly decrease as the robot size becomes smaller, due to limitations of feasible miniaturized on-board components. Here we propose an untethered jellyfish-inspired soft millirobot that could realize multiple functionalities in moderate Reynolds number by producing diverse controlled fluidic flows around its body using its magnetic composite elastomer lappets, which are actuated by an external oscillating magnetic field. We particularly investigate the interaction between the robot’s soft body and incurred fluidic flows due to the robot’s body motion, and utilize such physical interaction to achieve different predation-inspired object manipulation tasks. The proposed lappet kinematics can inspire other existing jellyfish-like robots to achieve similar functionalities at the same length and time scale. Moreover, the robotic platform could be used to study the impacts of the morphology and kinematics changing in ephyra jellyfish.Subject terms: Mechanical engineering, Actuators IntroductionUntethered miniature swimming robots1–8 are indispensable in biomedical and environmental monitoring and remediation applications. Although existing miniature swimming robots have shown interesting mobility, their advanced functionalities, such as object manipulation ability, significantly decrease as the robot size becomes smaller, due to limitations of their miniaturized on-board components9. To achieve the object manipulation function, microswimmers operating in the low Reynolds number (Re) regime have been proposed to incur controlled viscous fluidic flows to manipulate objects10–20. However, it is unclear whether such approach is applicable in the moderate Re regime, where both inertial and viscous forces play critical roles21.In nature, scyphomedusae ephyra, the juvenile of the most widely distributed jellyfish, can smartly control the fluidic flow around their body to realize diverse functionalities, such as propulsion22–24, predation25–28, and mixing of the surrounding fluid29, despite their simple body structure. Inspired by ephyra, we propose an untethered jellyfish-like soft millirobot, which could realize multiple functionalities by producing diverse controlled fluidic flows around its body using its lappets, which are actuated by magnetic composite elastomer and bent by remote magnetic fields. Using this experimental setup, we study five distinct swimming modes to particularly investigate the interaction between the robot’s soft body and incurred fluidic flows due to the robot’s body motion and utilize such physical interaction for predation-inspired object manipulation capability of the robot, in addition to the robot’s swimming propulsion, which has been the only focus of previous jellyfish-like robot studies1,2,5,30. The proposed soft robot’s different lappet motion kinematics are used to conduct four different robotic tasks: selectively trap and transport objects of two different sizes, burrow into granular media consisting of fine beads to either camouflage or search a target object, enhance the local mixing of two different chemicals, and generate a desired concentrated chemical path. The magnetic composite elastomer is chosen here because it can be actuated and controlled wirelessly and fast by remote magnetic fields, which have minimal effects on the fluidic flow under investigation. Existing robots, including other jellyfish-like robots1,2,5,30, could also complete the same tasks if they generate the same proposed lappet kinematics and local flow structures at the same length and time scale. Moreover, the proposed soft robotic platform, which has similar size and fluidic flow generating behaviors as an ephyra, could be used to study the impacts of changing their morphology and kinematics, which can happen due to pollutants, ionic changes, and temperature variation, to their survivability and habitat24,31–34. ResultsDesign and swimming behavior of the jellyfish-inspired swimming soft millirobotScyphomedusae ephyra (diameter: 1–10 mm) is characterized by its incomplete bell (Fig. 1a) and lappet paddling-based propulsion23,25,26,28. Inspired by such organism, our robot has a magnetic composite elastomer core (Supplementary Fig. 1), which can beat up and down its eight lappets in a non-reciprocal manner like an ephyra (Supplementary Fig. 4) under the control of an external magnetic field (B). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 2, each lappet has two compliant joints. Only the lappet distal joint is allowed to bend in the contraction phase, while both the distal and proximal joints of the lappet can bend in the recovery phase. This design induces a large wetted area during the contraction phase to acquire high thrust while decreasing the wetted area significantly during the recovery phase to reduce the drag force, just like the kinematics of a jellyfish ephyra (Supplementary Note 1). An air bubble of 0.3 µL is introduced on top of the robot body by a pipette to reduce the robot’s effective density to around 1.02 g⋅cm−3.Open in a separate windowFig. 1Design and swimming behavior of the jellyfish-inspired swimming soft millirobot. a Comparison in morphology. The newly budded scyphomedusae ephyra (Aurelia aurita) possesses deep clefts between two adjacent lappets. The design of the jellyfish-inspired soft millirobot captures such feature. The photo of the real animal is taken in a pet store and the animal’s care is in accordance with the institutional guidelines. b Kinematics and flow structures achieved by Mode A. The motion sequence, the velocity and vorticity fields, and the wake structures visualized by the fluorescein dye are all in one cycle. The three experiments are from three different trials using robots with the same design and kinematics. c Comparison of the robot and animal in two kinematic metrics: bell fineness and lappet velocity. The biological data is reproduced with permission from Feitl et al.28; permission is conveyed through Copyright Clearance Center, Inc. d Video snapshots of capturing a neutrally buoyant bead using the fluid flow around the robot’s lappetsWith this soft robot design, we first design the external B to make the robot mimic the swimming mode of an ephyra studied by Feitl et al.28 based on two common metrics quantifying the ephyra swimming kinematics: bell fineness and lappet velocity (Supplementary Note 5). The resulting biomimetic kinematics, referred as Mode A, are shown in Fig. 1b, c and Supplementary Movie 1. Keeping the beating frequency (2.5 Hz) and Reynolds number of the robot body (ReB = 7–95) similar to an ephyra25,27,28 (Supplementary Note 6), the robot can capture the typical flow structures of its biological counterpart23,30. As visualized by the particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique in the second row of Fig. 1b, the starting vortex forms at the beginning of the cycle (0 s) and dissipates quickly during the contraction (0–0.16 s). The stopping vortex forms a bit later than the starting vortex (0.08–0.16 s) and sheds during the recovery (0.24–0.32 s). This behavior contrasts to the well-formed starting-stopping vortex pair in an adult scyphomedusae23,35,36. During swimming, a portion of the surrounding water also propagates along with the robot due to the pressure field around the body37, causing an upward drift flow below (indicated at 0.24 s). The flow structures are further visualized by a fluorescein dye, and the dye tree structure is observed to grow during swimming due to the induced drift and boundary layer shedding (the third row in Fig. 1b), similar to that created by an ephyra29. With such flow structures, the robot can trap objects from outside to the inside of the sub-umbrella region (Supplementary Fig. 3b) during propulsion (Fig. 1d), similar to the predation behavior of an ephyra25.Five basic swimming modes and their propulsion performancesApart from Mode A, we prescribe other four swimming modes (Modes B1, B2, B3, and C) with distinct fluidic flow generating behaviors and swimming performances by changing the lappet beating kinematics of the robot (Fig. 2; Supplementary Movie 2). First, we decrease the duration of the contraction phase (tC) and recovery phase (tR) to generate Mode B1 and Mode B2, respectively, while maintaining the lappet beating amplitude of Mode A. This change increases the angular velocity of the lappets in each mode (ωC and ωR are defined in the inset of Fig. 2b). As expected, the displacement per cycle increases when the robot beats faster in contraction and decreases when the robot beats faster in recovery (Fig. 2a). However, such difference does not reveal in the average velocity (v̅robot, mm⋅s−1). In Fig. 2c, Mode B1 sees a significant increase in v̅robot while v̅robot for Mode B2 does not change significantly. This is because a shorter tR reduces the duration of a beating cycle (tC + tR) and makes the robot beat more frequently, compensating the loss in distance per cycle. Further reducing tR, however, would eventually reduce v̅robot to zero or even negative as the downward displacement in recovery would be equal to or even greater than the upward displacement in contraction. This trend can be explained by a dynamic model (Supplementary Figs. 10d and 10e and Supplementary Note 10). In addition to velocity, we also evaluate the propulsion efficiency by the reciprocal of the cost of transport (1/COT, Supplementary Note 7). As shown in Fig. 2c, Mode B1 results in a significant increase in 1/COT as the higher ReB associated with the higher v̅robot benefits the robot more from the inertia. On the contrary, Mode B2 dispenses more energy during the recovery, which decelerates the robot, reducing the 1/COT.Open in a separate windowFig. 2Five basic swimming modes being investigated and their impacts on swimming propulsion. a Kinematics of each swimming mode. The video snapshots of the start and end frames in one cycle are shown in the first row. One more frame is included for the glide phase of Mode B3. The red dashed lines indicate the final position of the robot in Mode A. The overlapped body profiles in one cycle are shown in the second row. b The difference in kinematics verified by angular velocity change. The beating angles and the angular velocities are defined in the inset. c The comparison in propulsion performance of each mode, showing the average velocity (v̅robot, mm⋅s-1) and efficiency represented by the reciprocal of cost of transport (1/COT). In b and c, the error bars represent the standard error of the mean, and N is the number of trialsBesides Mode B1 and Mode B2, the flexibility of this soft robot platform also allows combining swimming modes from other biological species into that of the ephyra. Therefore, we prescribe Mode B3 having an extra glide phase with duration tG after the contraction. Such a combination of stroke and glide phases is widely used by aquatic animals to save energy38. With such change, Mode B3 shows statistically significant increase in 1/COT (Fig. 2c), as the glide phase increases the displacement per cycle (Fig. 2a), while the work done within one cycle remains the same as Mode A. This result agrees with the fact that the inertia still plays an important role within the moderate ReB39. However, v̅robot does not increase significantly in Mode B3 as the peak speed, which is achieved at the end of the contraction, does not significantly change compared with Mode A. Moreover, further increasing tG would eventually slow down the robot due to the drag of the fluid and gravity (Supplementary Fig. 10f and Supplementary Note 10).At last, we also prescribe Mode C with a smaller beating amplitude by decreasing the recovery angle θR while maintaining the contraction angle θC (defined in the inset of Fig. 2b), as previous literature shows that θR and the lappet beating amplitude (θR−θC) of the ephyra gradually decrease during its growth27. This mode can help us understand how the robot performs with the kinematics of a larger-size ephyra than the one referred by Mode A28. Fig. 2c shows Mode C worsens v̅robot23 while 1/COT does not have a significant change. According to the dynamic model, the beating amplitude of Mode A is very close to the optimal value that maximize the swimming velocity, and further increasing or decreasing the beating amplitude of Mode A both slow down the robot (Supplementary Fig. 10c and Supplementary Note 10).Object collection capability of the five basic swimming modesChanging the swimming kinematics of the robot also affects its object manipulation capability. First, the object collecting performance of the robot is quantified in Fig. 3 by the exchange rate of the water volume into the sub-umbrella region (Qexchange, mm3⋅s−1). Qexchange is defined in Fig. 3b and implies how fast the water can be exchanged into the sub-umbrella region during one cycle, from the bottom boundary of the sub-umbrella. We assume the same amount of water volume is sucked in during the recovery and expelled out during the contraction (Supplementary Note 9). Therefore, we only integrate the feeding flow (vdrift−vrobot) initiating from the beginning (Fig. 3a) to the end of the recovery. In nature, ephyra relies on this feeding flow to carry the preys into its sub-umbrella region for further capture and digestion25.Open in a separate windowFig. 3The object collecting performance of the five basic swimming modes. a The flow field at the beginning of the recovery phase. The feeding flow is integrated from this time instant until the end of the recovery phase to estimate the volume flow sucked in during the recovery. The stronger stopping vortex suggests a stronger feeding flow. b The definition of Qexchange. The equation estimates the volume of the feeding flow Volfeeding exchanged into the sub-umbrella region by applying the axisymmetric assumption and integrating the 2D velocity obtained from PIV along the reference line. c Qexchange of the five basic swimming modes. A higher value indicates that the robot can collect objects faster. The error bars represent the standard error of the mean. N is the number of trialsAs Qexchange is proportional to (vdrift−vrobot)/T, it can be increased by either increasing (vdrift−vrobot) to make the robot move slower to engulf faster upwards drifting flow, or by decreasing T to increase the frequency of engulfing within a given time period. The experiment results support such prediction (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 9b). First, Qexchange increases significantly in both Mode B1, where vdrift rises, and Mode B2, where vrobot reduces. Second, the glide phase in Mode B3 has a negative contribution to Qexchange as an extra tG increases T while (vdrift−vrobot) is similar to Mode A. Third, Mode C lowers Qexchange as vdrift decreases and vrobot increases during the recovery, which results in a smaller (vdrift−vrobot).Object retaining capability of the five basic swimming modesIn addition to object collecting performance, Fig. 4 shows the object retaining performance of the robot investigated by tracing the trajectories of the trapped beads (Supplementary Movie 3). Neutrally buoyant beads are used here to exclude the effect of gravity. The results are quantified by the cycles and distance (mm) of a bead being retained by the robot. After being trapped inside the sub-umbrella region, a neutrally buoyant bead has two ways to escape (Fig. 4c). In Mechanism-1, the bead can escape with a probability, PC, during the contraction phase. It acquires the momentum for escaping from the downward flow generated by contraction and can be further enhanced by the beating of the lappets. In Mechanism-2, the bead can escape with a probability, PR, during the recovery phase. It acquires the momentum for escaping from the stopping vortex and escapes from the distal tip of the lappet. Both PC and PR determine the retaining cycles and can be tuned with tC, tR and θR (θC does not change in five basic modes) in our experiment. As accurately calculating PC and PR requires infinite trials of experiments, we can only obtain estimated P’C and P’R (Fig. 5g, see “Methods: Estimating the escaping probabilities”). As summarized in Figs. 5 and ​and6,6, weak contraction (larger tC) and tighter sub-umbrella region (smaller θR) make the robot retain the beads for more cycles while changing tR has contradicting effects on P’C and P’R. A detailed discussion is provided below.Open in a separate windowFig. 4The object retaining performance of the five basic swimming modes. a The typical translation trajectories of neutrally buoyant beads.

In the right frame, the bead completely escapes the control of the robot. b The retaining metrics quantified by neutrally buoyant beads.

The comparisons between Modes B1, B2, B3, and C with Mode A are shown in a-d, respectively. The green up arrow, the red down arrow, and the black line indicate, respectively, the increase, decrease, and no change in kinematic parameter value or probability. The dashed and solid curves indicate, respectively, the positions of the robot body at the last and the current phases. The green and red dots indicate, respectively, the positions of the object at the last and the current phasesFirst, P’C and P’R increase with decreasing tC (Mode B1, Figs. 5a, g and ​and6a).6a). When tC shortens, the downward fluidic flow during contraction becomes stronger and the chance of physical contact between the lappets and the beads increases, enhancing the Mechanism-1 and increasing P’C. In addition, the strong stopping vortex (Supplementary Fig. 8) induced by high propulsion speed circulates more beads out of the sub-umbrella region during the upcoming recovery phase, enhancing the Mechanism-2 and increasing P’R. With both P’C and P’R increase, the object retaining cycles decrease (Fig. 4b). However, the overall retaining distance of Mode B1 does not decrease significantly, as Mode B1 makes the robot have a longer displacement per cycle (Fig. 2a), compensating the loss in the retaining cycles.Second, P’R increases with decreasing tR (Mode B2, Figs. 5b, ​b,5g,5g, and ​and6b)6b) as shorter tR creates a stronger stopping vortex (Supplementary Fig. 8) and more beads could be circulated out from the distal tip of the lappet during recovery through Mechanism-2 (Fig. 5f), increasing P’R. In contrast, P’C decreases with decreasing tR as reducing tR increases the recapture of the beads beaten out during the last contraction phase, weakening the Mechanism-1 (Fig. 5e, see “Methods: Bead trajectory tracing experiments”). Therefore, in Mode B2, the increase in P’R compensates the loss in P’C. Consequently, the retaining cycles do not show statistically significant change (Fig. 4b).Third, P’C and P’R decrease with decreasing θR (Mode C, Figs. 5d, g and ​and6d).6d). Reducing θR solely decreases ωC and ωR, which consequently reduces the magnitude and scale of the vortices incurred (Supplementary Fig. 8). Therefore, the beads circulate slower inside the sub-umbrella region and are less likely to escape through both Mechanism-1 and Mechanism-2. Moreover, a smaller θR creates a tighter sub-umbrella region during contraction, and it squeezes the beads towards the robot central axis, where a stronger upward drifting flow exists (Fig. 1b). This behavior increases the chance of the beads being recaptured by the upcoming recovery phase, decreasing P’C (Fig. 5e, see “Methods: Bead trajectory tracing experiments”). During the recovery, the tighter sub-umbrella region makes the trapped beads have more chances to collide with the inner wall of the sub-umbrella region when they try to escape through the Mechanism-2, decreasing P’R. With P’C and P’R both reduced, Mode C greatly increases the retaining cycles and distance of the trapped beads (Fig. 4b).At last, increasing tG does not alter P’C, P’R (Mode B3, Figs. 5c, g and ​and6c)6c) and hence the retaining cycles (Fig. 4b). There is no fluid exchange during gliding (Supplementary Fig. 9b) and consequently, the beads can keep their positions relative to the robot. Therefore, Mode B3 is observed to have no significant change in retaining cycles in comparison with Mode A. For each retaining cycle, however, the beads can travel a longer distance as it is possible to tune tG to make the robot have longer displacement per cycle than Mode A (Supplementary Fig. 10f), which is the case for Mode B3 (Fig. 2a).Note that the probabilistic estimate of the bead transportation is based on idealized assumptions. More experiments are needed to find the extent to which the P’C and P’R are still valid, e.g., in more complex conditions.Four robotic tasks realized by newly prescribed modesThe swimming propulsion and object manipulation performances of the above five basic swimming modes are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 shows that no swimming mode performs best in all aspects. For example, Mode B1, who is better in propulsion and object collecting while worse in object retaining, contrasts with Mode C, who is worse in propulsion and object collecting while better in object retaining. Based on Table 1, we prescribe additional new modes (Modes D, E, F, and G) with different lappet kinematics to enable the robot to achieve specific tasks, other than swimming, as shown in Fig. 7.Table 1Summary of propulsion and object manipulation performances of different basic swimming modesModeKinematic parameters being changedAngular velocityPropulsion performanceObject manipulation performanceObject collectingObject retaining ω R  ω C  V̅ robot  1COT  Q exchange Retaining cyclesRetaining distance B1  t C                 B2  t R                 B3  t G                 C  θ R                Open in a separate windowNote: The increase and decrease in kinematic parameter values or angular velocities are, respectively, marked by black up and down arrows.

The robot can use Mode D1 to transport large beads (diameter: 0.99 mm ± 0.025 mm, density: 1.05 g⋅cc-1) while expelling small beads (diameter: 500–600 µm, density: 1.05 g⋅cc-1). It can also use Mode D2 to transport small beads and leave behind large beads. b Burrowing for camouflage and searching in fine beads (diameter: 200–300 µm density: 1.05 g⋅cc-1) with Mode E. c Locally mixing two food dyes with different colors using Mode F. d Generating a desired concentrated chemical path. The robot can swim upwards to create a straight chemical path with Mode C. It can also be steered in 2D to create a desired S-shaped chemical path with Mode GAs the first task, the robot can selectively transport beads with different sizes from the bottom to the top of the water tank using the proposed Mode D1 (trapping large beads while expelling small beads) and Mode D2 (trapping small beads while leaving large beads) in Fig. 7a (Supplementary Movie 4). Such selective transportation is useful to transport and deliver drug type of cargos6 in biomedical applications, collect samples with specific size1,40 for environmental monitoring, and clean microplastics for environmental cleaning41. Beads heavier than water (density: 1.05 g⋅cc−1) are used here to ensure that they initially stay at the tank bottom for fair comparison. For such beads, gravity enables a third escape mechanism (Mechanism-3) if the beads carried by drift flow cannot catch up with the moving robot. Through an analysis of the drag force and gravity, we know that when the densities are the same, the larger beads are easier to escape through the Mechanism-3, and hence requires a faster average feeding flow speed (v̅feeding) to catch up with the robot. A thorough discussion on the mechanism of selective transportation and prescribing kinematics can be found in Supplementary Note 12. In summary, we prescribe Mode D1 with a larger v̅feeding to trap and transport the large beads. While the small beads are expelled due to the shorter relaxation time. In contrast, by reducing θR relative to Mode D1, we prescribe Mode D2 with smaller v̅feeding and better object retaining capability. Therefore, the robot can leave behind the large beads while retaining small beads. Such selective trapping and transportation is repeatable and quantified in Supplementary Figs. 18 and 20.As the second task, the robot can also burrow, by interacting with the solid granular medium on the bottom surface. Inspired by many sand-dwelling animals that burrow to predate or to escape from the predators42,43, here we show that our robot can burrow into granular media to either camouflage or search a buried object under the fine beads using Mode E (Fig. 7b, Supplementary Movie 5). To realize burrowing, the recovery phase of Mode E is prescribed to be much stronger than the contraction phase (ωC = 17.36 rad⋅s−1 < ωR = 39.31 rad⋅s−1) and to reach the largest θR that can be achieved in our system (θR = 2.63 rad). Therefore, the robot cannot propel upwards and stays at the bottom. The stronger recovery than any other swimming modes also makes the beads under the body easier to be expelled through the Mechanism-2. Some of the beads are expelled directly to the side of the robot (Supplementary Fig. 21b). Other beads are first expelled up and then beaten away further by the lappets during the following recovery phases (Supplementary Fig. 21c). For camouflage, the robot is required to bury itself. Therefore, the robot is positioned flat. The beads under the robot are first expelled up, and then they gradually settle down and bury the robot body. For object searching, however, the robot is required to expel out the beads with a tilted angle to avoid the beads falling back and covering the target object again. Therefore, the robot is tilted to expel beads obliquely. The robot eventually finds the target black bead and expels it out. A detailed discussion on the burrowing process can be found in Supplementary Note 13.As the third task, we demonstrate that the robot can enhance the local mixing of the fluids using Mode F (Fig. 7c, Supplementary Movie 6), which is inspired by the discovery that the swimming of the ephyra helps to enhance the mixing of the ocean at the moderate Re29. Many marine species, such as asteroids, sea urchin and some corals, reproduce externally by releasing gametes into the surrounding flow44–46, and the successful fertilization relies on the sperm-egg contacts45. Finding effective kinematics for untethered miniature swimming robots to mix the fluids locally may potentially help these organisms to increase the contact chance of the gametes, boosting their reproduction. Compared with Mode A, Mode F increases both the contraction (ωC = 27.61 rad⋅s−1) and the recovery (ωR = 27.70 rad⋅s−1) to locally enhance mixing. With the recovery phase being slightly stronger than the contraction phase, the robot can suspend at the bottom center of the tank. During mixing, the robot first draws dyes from both sides during recovery, then squeezes the dyes from both sides to the sub-umbrella region by contraction, and finally redistributes the mixed dye back to the environment through Mechanism-1 and Mechanism-2 (Supplementary Fig. 22). A detailed discussion on the mixing process can be found in Supplementary Note 14.As the last task, we demonstrate that the robot can generate a desired chemical path in its wake by using Mode C (Fig. 7d, Supplementary Movie 7). This function could be useful in spreading pheromones (or other specific chemicals) into desired positions, by which the robot could intentionally interact with aquatic animals by controlling their migration, mating, and various social behaviors47. We choose Mode C to finish this task as it has the best object retaining performance (Table 1) and can better resist the spreading of the chemicals. When swimming upwards with Mode C from the dye bolus injected on the tank bottom, the robot can create a straight and concentrated chemical path in comparison with other basic modes (Supplementary Fig. 23b). We then show that the chemical path can also be generated as a more complex S-shaped trajectory by using the external magnetic field to steer the robot in two dimensions by Mode G (Fig. 7d). In comparison with Mode C, Mode G lets the robot beat and swim faster with a smaller sub-umbrella region. A detailed discussion on creating the chemical path can be found in Supplementary Note 15. DiscussionsThe untethered jellyfish-like soft millirobot, which has similar size and fluidic flow generation behavior as an ephyra, can achieve diverse physical functions and robotic tasks by manipulating its surrounding fluidic flow. The ability to utilize the fluidic flow to achieve multiple functions and tasks is independent of the magnetic field since the incurred flow structures only rely on the interplay between the robot body and the fluid. Therefore, the above design and swimming modes may potentially be realized by current or future jellyfish-like soft robots built with other on-board or off-board actuation methods48 such as biological muscle cells30, shape memory alloys5, hydraulic actuators1, dielectric elastomers2,49, hydrogels50, and liquid crystal elastomers51.In addition, this robotic platform could also be used as a scientific tool to further study the behaviors of ephyrae due to its various advantages, such as the ability to change the locomotion mode on demand and not being influenced by physiological factors52,53. Ephyrae hold a critical position in ocean ecological system due to their large quantity and wide distribution54. Although many previous researches have studied ephyrae’s most typical swimming kinematics23,25–29, the impacts of changing the morphology and kinematics of the ephyrae to their survivability and habitat, which can happen when the environment is affected by pollutants31–33, ion concentration change34, and temperature variation24, remains to be further investigated using such tool as a future work. MethodsMagnetic composite elastomer coreThe detailed design of the magnetic composite elastomer core is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1a. The core has a thickness of 65 µm. The circumscribed circle of the core has a diameter of 3 mm. A circular hole with a diameter of 0.5 mm is designed in the robot center to trap the bubble. To ensure that the bubble trapped on the top does not go through the hole to the bottom, an elastic ring with a thickness of 65 µm is designed to be on the top center of the magnetic composite elastomer core.The magnetic composite elastomer has been reported in our previous work7. It is a composite of the soft silicone rubber (Ecoflex 00–10, Smooth-On Inc.) and the neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnetic microparticles (MQP-15-7, Magnequench; average diameter: 5 µm) with a mass ratio of 1:1. The resulting magnetic elastomer has a density of 1.86 g⋅cm−3. The mixture is then cast onto a flat poly (methyl methacrylate) plate coated with a thin layer of parylene C (6 µm thick) to form a thin film with a thickness of 65 µm. The material is then put into the oven under 60 ℃ for curing around 1 h. After curing, the magnetic part is cut out by using the UV laser. The elastic ring for fixing the bubble position is nonmagnetic and is made of Ecoflex 00–10 loaded with aluminum powder (5413 H Super, laborladen.de) in a weight ratio of 1:2. It is fabricated in a similar way as the magnetic core and then glued to the magnetic composite elastomer core by Ecoflex 00–10.The magnetic composite elastomers mentioned above are hydrophobic, which is determined through the sessile droplet method. The static water contact angle of the material used to build the magnetic composite elastomer core is characterized to be 108 ± 3°. The static water contact angle of the material used to build the elastic ring is characterized to be 110 ± 5°. To create the magnetization profile of the core, a water droplet is pipetted on the core (Supplementary Fig. 1c). The core can automatically wrap the droplet due to the attraction of the water droplet55, forming an ellipsoidal shape (Supplementary Figs. 1d and 1e). The volume of the water droplet is well controlled to be 1 µL using a pipette. We then put the core along with the water droplet in a freezer until the water droplet is totally frozen. This is to fix the ellipsoidal shape of the core during the magnetization process. We finally apply a strong uniform B field (1.8 T) inside a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM, EZ7, Microsense) in the direction shown in Supplementary Fig. 1d, which makes the magnetization magnitude to be 71,700 ± 1725 A·m−1 and generates the magnetization profile shown in Supplementary Fig. 1f. With such magnetization profile, the magnetic composite elastomer core can deform upwards when By > 0, and deform downwards when By < 0 (Supplementary Fig. 1b). When By = 0, however, the magnetic composite elastomer core still shows a curvature. As discussed in our previous work7, such deformation at the rest state may be caused by the residual strain energy due to the fabrication process. We currently have not observed any influence of this residual strain energy on our experiment results.The robot can be steered by rotating the direction of the applied B field. With an additional horizontal pair of coil set, we can steer the robot in the 2D plane by applying magnetic torque (Supplementary Movies 1 and 7). In the last scene of Supplementary Movie 1, the robot toddles slightly when it tilts too much from swimming vertically. However, this does not affect the steering of the robot. There are two possible reasons for this. First, the deformation of the magnetic composite elastomer core is not perfectly axial symmetric, causing the net magnetic moment deviating from its central axis and inducing the undesired magnetic torque. Second, this might be due to the bubble, which is trapped on top of the body, providing a self-righting torque, which always rotates the robot central axis back to be vertical. We observe that such phenomenon relieves when the beating frequency increases and beating amplitude reduces as in Supplementary Movie 7. Such dynamic process would be further investigated in the future.Passive lappetsThe detailed design of the passive lappets is shown in Supplementary Fig. 2a. Each passive lappet is composed of five parts: T stopper, proximal pad, distal pad, proximal joint and distal joint. The T stopper, proximal pad, and distal pad are all made of parylene C. They are cut out from a layer of parylene C with a thickness of 6 µm. The proximal and distal joints linking the proximal and the distal pads are made of Ecoflex 00–10. They have an average thickness of 15 µm. The T stopper can restrict the upward bending of the proximal joint while having little influence on the downward bending. With such mechanism, the proximal joint bends less during the contraction phase than during the recovery phase (Supplementary Fig. 2c).With the robot center pinned on a pillar (restricting only the vertical translation), the frequency response of the whole lappet, including both magnetic lappet and passive lappet, is tested under sinusoidal By fields of three different magnitudes (10, 20, and 30 mT) and different frequencies (0.5–30 Hz) (see Supplementary Fig. 2b). Five measurements are conducted for each case. In this report, we borrow the concept of cut-off frequency from the linear system to clarify the relation between the actuating magnetic field (magnitude and frequency) and the resultant beating amplitude. We define the cut-off frequency of the lappet to be the frequency at which the beating amplitude, θR−θC, is 0.707 times that achieved under 0.5 Hz. Linear least square regression is used to obtain the relation between the actuation frequency and the beating amplitude to find out the cut-off frequency (Supplementary Fig. 2b). In Supplementary Fig. 2b, we show that the cut-off frequency of the lappet can be increased by increasing the B field magnitude. In the future, the non-linearity in frequency response (e.g., the frequency response observed at 10 mT) will be investigated.Electromagnetic coil setup and particle image velocimetry systemThe schematic of the experimental setup for quantitative characterization experiments is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3a. The two electromagnetic coils providing the uniform vertical external magnetic field are arranged in the Helmholtz configuration. 95% homogeneous region of the coils is measured to be 45 mm along Y direction. The largest |B| it can provide is 30 mT. During the experiment, the robot swims in a transparent water tank situating at the central region of the coil system. The dimension of the tank used for quantifying the five basic swimming modes is 100 × 60 × 40 mm3 (length × width × height). To minimize the viscosity change due to the temperature variation and guarantee the comparability of the results, the coil system is water cooled, and all the experiments are conducted at around 23 ℃. To minimize the wall and surface effects, only the experimental data obtained when the robot swims at least 5 mm away from the bottom and the water-air interface are adopted. The fluid flow around the robot is characterized by a PIV system (Dantec Dynamics, Inc.). The water is evenly seeded with 1 µm-diameter polystyrene particles loaded with fluorochrome dye (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR, USA; 1.1 ± 0.035 µm) which can be excited with a laser at 535 nm wavelength and emits fluorescence at 575 nm. The laser beam (1000 Hz, 527 nm) is expanded into a plane and projected vertically from the water tank bottom. The movement of the particles is captured using a high-speed camera (M310, Phantom, Inc.). A 570 nm high-pass lens filter is used to increase the contrast between the PIV particles and the background. The image sequences recorded are then processed in the commercial software (DynamicStudio 2016a, Dantec Dynamics, Inc.) to obtain velocity fields by applying a cross-correlation algorithm. The characterization experiments are all performed in this setup using multiple robots with the same design. No fatigue of the robot has been observed throughout our experiments.Currently, the control of the robot is realized by providing an oscillating magnetic field along its body central axis. Therefore, the controllable degree of freedoms (DOFs) of the robot’s rigid-body translational and rotational motions depend on the configuration of the electromagnetic coil system. With a single pair of fixed electromagnets, we have one control DOF for controlling the 1-DOF rigid body translational motion (e.g., swimming vertically in characterization experiments). With one more pair of fixed electromagnets, one more controllable DOF for rotational motion can be obtained and steering the robot in 2D can be achieved (e.g., generating S-shaped chemical path). To improve the control performance, we can add more coils to the system56,57, improve the dynamic model (Supplementary Note 10), and implement visual feedback control.Definition of the sub-umbrella regionThe sub-umbrella or bell region is the area used by the robot to trap objects, similar to ephyra trapping its prey. The sub-umbrella region is defined in Supplementary Fig. 3b. When the robot deforms its body into a bell shape (0.08–0.24 s in Supplementary Fig. 3b), the sub-umbrella region is defined to be the enclosed region between a reference line that links the lappet tips of both sides and the whole robot body30. When the robot deforms into an inversed-bell shape (0 s, 0.32–0.40 s in Supplementary Fig. 3b), the sub-umbrella region is defined to be the area enclosed by the robot body and a horizontal reference line that is 300 µm away from the bottom of the robot. 300 µm distance is selected here to accommodate at least one small bead (used in bead trajectory tracing experiments, 212–250 µm in diameter) right below the robot’s body.Kinematics of five basic swimming modesWe use two methods to tune the five basic swimming modes. All the control signals used are shown in Supplementary Fig. 5d. In the first approach, we tune the duration of each phase of Mode A while maintaining the beating amplitude to generate other three basic swimming modes (Modes B1, B2, and B3). Specifically, Mode B1 has a shorter contraction (tC), 21.76% of that in Mode A, while the recovery duration (tR) is kept unchanged. Consequently, the average angular velocity of the contraction ωC = (θR−θC) / tC = 55.85 rad⋅s−1 is larger than ωC = 12.16 rad⋅s−1 of Mode A, and the contraction is more powerful. Mode B2 has a shorter recovery (tR), and its recovery phase is 50.13% of that in Mode A, while the tC is the same. Consequently, the angular velocity of the recovery ωR = (θR−θC)/tR = 11.69 rad⋅s−1 is larger than ωR = 5.89 rad⋅s−1 of Mode A, and the recovery is more powerful. Mode B3 has an extra glide phase compared with Mode A, and the glide duration tG = 0.2 s.In the second approach, we prescribe Mode C with smaller beating amplitude by decreasing θR while maintaining θC and the duration of each phase the same compared with Mode A. Consequently, the average velocities of both the contraction and the recovery phases (ωC = 6.27 rad⋅s−1, ωR = 3.04 rad⋅s−1) are weaker than Mode A.We do not change the lappet kinematics by simply changing the actuation frequency, f, because of the following reasons. First, since the beating period T = 1/f = tC + tR + tG, changing the actuation frequency f alters tC, tR and tG at the same time. Second, only changing f can also change the beating angles θR and θC, as well as the beating amplitude θR−θC (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Therefore, only changing f is not appropriate if the impacts of each kinematic parameter (tC, tR, tG, θR, and θC) are to be investigated. Also, see Supplementary Notes 3 and 4 for the details of tuning individual kinematic parameters while maintaining others.Note that θC doesn’t change for all characterization modes. Under the current experiment setup, the minimum θC, the maximum θR, the maximum ωC, and the maximum ωR that can be achieved are, respectively, 0.44 rad, 2.63 rad, 55.85 rad⋅s−1, and 39.31 rad⋅s−1.Bead trajectory tracing experimentsThe bead trajectory tracing experiments  shown in Fig. 4 are conducted in a transparent water tank with a size of 100 × 60 × 40 mm3 (length × width × height). Polystyrene beads with the diameter of 212–250 µm and density of 1.00 g⋅cc−1 (Cospheric, Inc.) are used to exclude the effect of the gravity. This is in accordance with the natural preys of ephyrae, as their sizes range from 100 to 5000 µm26 and are often regarded as neutrally buoyant58. In each experiment trial, the robot swims upwards from the tank bottom, and the beads scattered in the water are randomly captured by the robot. The motion of the robot and the beads are captured by a high-speed camera with a frame rate of 500 frames per second (fps). For each swimming mode, the experiment is repeated for 5–10 times. See Fig. 4a, Fig. 5a-d, and Supplementary Movie 3 for the typical transportation trajectory of the bead in each mode.We manually trace the trajectories of the beads captured into the sub-umbrella region and use two metrics, retaining cycles and retaining distance (mm), to quantify the object retaining performance. The retaining cycle is defined as the cycle number of a bead being retained during the trapping process. The retaining distance is defined as the distance of a bead being transported during the trapping process. The trapping process begins at the time instant when the bead is first captured into the sub-umbrella region and terminates when the beads completely escape. Here, the word ‘completely’ means the escaped beads will not be recaptured into the sub-umbrella region during the rest of the trial (the end of the whole upwards swimming process).Apart from the metrics defined above, we also quantify two indicators: the recapture rate and the proportion of escaping through Mechanism-2 (Fig. 5e, f). Recapture usually happens to a bead that is beaten out during the contraction (Mechanism-1) but is still near the drift flow of the robot. The upcoming recovery phases can then pull the bead back into the sub-umbrella region. The recapture rate indicates the proportion of beads that are recaptured during the transportation process, among all the beads that are transported. It can be used to indicate whether the escaping through Mechanism-1 is reduced. The proportion of escaping through Mechanism-2 evaluates the proportion of the beads that escape through Mechanism-2, among all the beads that escape. A higher value indicates that a trapped bead has a higher chance to escape during the recovery.Since the beads are captured randomly, the number of the counted beads in different swimming modes are different. In Modes A, B1, B2, B3, and C, the number of the counted beads are respectively 32, 30, 35, 31, and 18.Estimating the escaping probabilitiesThe process of the bead transportation shown in our experiments (Fig. 4) is very complicated. The neutrally buoyant beads are randomly seeded in the water and are randomly trapped by the robot. It is hard to find a simple and deterministic rule to predict the trajectory of each bead being trapped. Since we know little about the whole transporting process, probabilistic models are applicable to describe the complex behavior of the system59. As for a neutrally buoyant bead, we assume each swimming cycle of the robot is an independent event that can produce two outcomes. In the first outcome, the trapped bead escapes the sub-umbrella region with probability Pout. In the second outcome, the trapped bead is still retained within the sub-umbrella region with probability 1–Pout. If we further assume the probabilities of these two outcomes hold constant, the number of the beating cycles needed to expel a trapped bead has a geometric distribution. The expected number of the retaining cycles can then be expressed as:Eretain= limk→∞∑n=1kn(1-Pout)n-1Pout1In the first outcome, the escape probability Pout can be expressed as Pout = PC + PR because the beads can escape either through Mechanism-1 with probability PC (during contraction) or through Mechanism-2 with probability PR (during recovery). With the above assumptions, Equation 1 can be formulated as:Eretain= limk→∞∑n=1k1-Poutn-1PC+PR=PC limk→∞∑n=1k1-Poutn-1+PR limk→∞∑n=1k1-Poutn-1=Eretain-1+Eretain-22where Eretain−1 and Eretain−2 are, respectively, the expected number of the retaining cycles of a bead that is expelled through Mechanism-1 and Mechanism-2. Eretain−1 and Eretain−2 can further be derived as:Eretain-1= limk→∞PC1-1-PoutkPout2-k1-PoutkPoutEretain-2= limk→∞PR1-1-PoutkPout2-k1-PoutkPout3Because 0 <Pout <1 and k → ∞, we can obtain Eretain-1=PCPout2 and Eretain-2=PRPout2 from Eq. 3. As it is impossible to implement infinite trials of experiments (k → ∞), theoretically we cannot get PC and PR from the experiment results. However, if we assume the average retaining cycles of the trapped beads from the beads tracing experiments (Fig. 4b) as reasonable estimations to Eretain−1 and Eretain−2, then we can obtain probabilities P’C and P’R for each swimming mode (Fig. 5g). Therefore, if P’C = PC and P’R = PR, then Eretain−1 and Eretain−II are the expected value for the cycling number recorded in the experiment.In fact, the last beating cycle does have an influence on the following beating cycle, since the initial position and velocity of the bead of the following cycle are influenced by the last beating. Probabilities are given here to provide an insight into the experimental results and provide a guideline for designing kinematics. Strict stochastic modeling about retaining capabilities will be conducted in the future.Beads with a higher density than water may fall out of the sub-umbrella region or lag behind the robot due to the gravity, in addition to Mechanisms-1 and 2. This is classified as the escape Mechanism-3. Mechanism-3 is discussed in Supplementary Note 12 and is not included here.Materials used in the demonstrated four tasksIn selective transportation experiments, we use two kinds of polystyrene beads with different sizes (Polysciences, Inc.). The diameters of the large beads are 965–1015 µm, and the diameters of the small beads are 500–600 µm. Both the large and small beads have the same densities (1.05 g⋅cc−1). In burrowing experiments, the fine beads are 200–300 µm, density of 1.05 g⋅cc−1 (Polysciences, Inc.). The target objects to be searched are large beads painted with black ink (diameter: 965–1015 µm, density: 1.05 g⋅cc−1, Polysciences, Inc.). In local mixing experiments, the dyes used for demonstrations are food dyes (Bakeryteam, GmbH). In chemical path generation experiments, we use fluorescein sodium as the chemical to be distributed (Fisher Scientific U.K., Ltd.).Statistical method and normalizationBecause of the limited sample size, the two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test is applied to examine the statistical significance. The test is conducted between the values of Mode A and the values of the other four basic swimming modes. Asterisks are used to denote the statistically significant difference. *, **, and *** denote P ≤ 0.05, P ≤ 0.01, and P ≤ 0.001, respectively.To easily visualize the difference between Mode A and other modes, the experimental data are normalized. The values of each data set are first divided by the average value of Mode A and then subtract 1. Therefore, a positive value indicates the performance of the corresponding swimming mode outperforms Mode A, while a negative value indicates the corresponding swimming mode underperforms Mode A.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/23611564/,"IntroductionComplex organisms are composed of tissues in which most cells are embedded within a fibrous extracellular matrix (ECM). The mechanical properties of this matrix not only allow such tissues to withstand daily stresses, but also regulate numerous cellular functions such as spreading, migration, proliferation and stem cell differentiation [1], thus impacting many fundamental biological processes including embryonic development, adult tissue homeostasis, and the pathogenesis of diseases such as fibrosis and cancer [2–5].Although a large body of data loosely suggests that matrix mechanics is an important factor in driving cellular behavior, there are several limitations to each of the approaches taken to study this phenomenon. In particular, because changes in matrix stiffness often occur simultaneously with changes in other material properties, e.g. surface chemistry, topography or availability of adhesive ligands, it is difficult to convincingly demonstrate that stiffness alone is responsible for the observed effects. Here, we will attempt to describe the various methods that have been used to modulate matrix mechanics, the biological responses that have been reported, and the potential mechanisms by which these responses occur. Protein gels as mimics of natural ECMGels based on natural ECMs, such as type I collagen, Matrigel and fibrin are composed of proteins that self-assemble in vitro into higher order nanofibrous structures, which reasonably mimic many in vivo settings, and were the first materials used to suggest an impact of stiffness on cell fate. Studies in collagen and fibrin gels demonstrated that increasing crosslinking of matrix, which modulates matrix stiffness, impacts integrin signaling and actomyosin-mediated cellular tension, important parameters in tumor growth [6–8]. Differentiation and proliferation of normal cells are also regulated by these ECM protein gels. For example, mammary epithelial cells cultured on soft, as opposed to stiff, gels mimicking normal tissue stiffness maintained expression of β-casein, a milk protein used as functional differentiation marker for mammary epithelial cells [9].Despite the clear evidence that matrix manipulations appear to impact cell function, it is difficult in these systems to unequivocally isolate the contribution of substrate stiffness from other important structural changes in the matrix (Figure 1A). In most studies, gel stiffness is varied by changing protein weight percentage in the gel precursor solution, making orthogonal control over mechanics and ligand density impossible. Importantly, ligand density alone (which can be varied simply by coating ECM onto rigid surfaces) is known to influence integrin dependent signaling [10]. Hence, if we are to understand the contribution of stiffness per se, it is necessary to decouple the two parameters. Recent approaches to control natural ECM stiffness have used non-enzymatic collagen glycation to obtain scaffolds with compressive moduli ranging from 175 to 730 Pa, without changing overall collagen density [11]. Although this is a promising approach, the obtainable stiffness range is inadequate compared to the relevant in vivo range spanning hundreds of kPa, and the chemical composition of the material changes for different stiffnesses as proteins are crosslinked by varying concentrations of ribose. Other chemical crosslinking methods including glutaraldehyde, carbodiimide or hexamethylene diisocyanate treatment of collagen [12] and more recently, photochemically-induced fibrin crosslinking [13], also yield limited stiffness ranges. Furthermore, many of these crosslinking agents target primary amines and carboxylates on the matrix backbone, which also contain specific adhesion receptor binding sequences. Thus, such crosslinking agents may also directly alter adhesion ligand availability.Open in a separate windowFigure 1Structural features of protein gels (A) and synthetic hydrogels (B) at the micron- and nano-scale. Substrate mechanics influence matrix density, ligand availability (A) and hydrogel pore size (B). Fully synthetic hydrogelsTo address these limitations in natural ECMs, fully synthetic, covalently crosslinked hydrogels with tunable stiffness and orthogonal control over adhesive ligand density have been developed as new model ECMs. Unlike the majority of natural fibrous materials, synthetic gel stiffness is generally not affected by deformation magnitude or rate, and the gels are therefore considered linear elastic and defined by a single bulk modulus. Studies of cells cultured on the surface of matrix-coated polyacrylamide hydrogels have revealed numerous effects of substrate stiffness on cells. Stiffness modulates the speed of migration of cultured cells, with lower motility on stiff substrates correlating with increased focal adhesion formation [14]. Substrates patterned with stiffness gradients revealed preferential movement of cells from soft towards stiff regions, a process called durotaxis [15]. Finally, Engler et al. demonstrated that substrate mechanics can direct lineage fate in human mesenchymal stem cells [16]. The stiffness that optimally drove specific lineages (e.g. myoblasts) corresponded with the stiffness of the relevant target tissue (e.g. skeletal muscle).To study multiple parameters governing cell-ECM interactions individually, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels with tunable mechanics and incorporated functionalities (tethered ECM ligands and growth factors) mimicking natural ECM properties have been designed [17,18]. Unlike polyacrylamide, the unpolymerized components of these gels are cytocompatible. Therefore, such tailored hydrogel systems can also be used to encapsulate cells and study stiffness in three dimensions (3D) [19,20]. Other common synthetic materials used are based on sugars, such as hyaluronan, dextran or alginate [21–23]. Due to the abundance of available functional groups along the polymer backbone, sugars offer more flexibility than PEG in terms of chemical modifications with crosslinking moieties or bioactive molecules. These materials are just now allowing researchers to examine the relative contributions of ECM stiffness versus density of adhesive ligands.Hydrogels have attracted a lot of attention as fully synthetic model substrates, partially due to their porous nature ensuring the supply of nutrients, growth factors and oxygen to the cell, thus mimicking the structure of natural tissues. However, one major drawback is that porosity changes with variations in material stiffness (Figure 1B), impairing e.g. the diffusion of small molecules in stiff matrices [24]. Additionally, these synthetic matrices only recapitulate some of the properties of in vivo ECM. In many two dimensional (2D) studies, cells adhere to an ECM coating bound to the hydrogel surface and hence, sense an integrated stiffness dictated by the mechanics of the material itself, but also the mechanical properties of the ECM protein film (which often times is made of fibrous units with heterogeneous stiffness distributions), and how that ECM coating is tethered to the underlying substrate. The importance of ligand presentation has been demonstrated for both growth factor and integrin-mediated signaling [25,26]. For example, cells cultured on rigid surfaces functionalized with RGD via PEG linkers of different length showed a decrease of cell-substrate interactions for longer spacers [27,28], indicating that the mechanical feedback of the adhesive ligand is crucial for integrin-dependent signaling. In synthetic hydrogels, ECM tethering is greatly influenced by the pore size, which changes as hydrogel stiffness is varied. A recent study has shown that cells cultured on polyacrylamide hydrogels with covalently anchored collagen were influenced by the tethering mechanics of collagen. Stiffer hydrogels with smaller pore sizes offer more anchoring points for each collagen fibril, leading to increased mechanical feedback at each cell adhesion [29]. The nanotopography of surfaces, as well as the arrangement of adhesive ligands have previously been shown to influence cell fate [30,31], and thus changes in gel crosslinking appear to impact cell function in part through their indirect effects on matrix tethering.These complex mechanisms by which cells could be transducing changes in matrix structure and mechanics underscore a need to decouple mechanical properties from ligand presentation in hydrogel systems. To address this, Spatz and co-workers have developed gold nanoparticle embedded PEG hydrogel substrates with tunable stiffness and independent control over biomolecule arrangement on the nanometer scale [32], providing a platform to study mechanotransduction events and adhesion-dependent signalling independently. Additionally, our group has developed poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) elastomer substrates with vertically arrayed microposts that bend laterally when a cell attaches and exerts force to the substrate [33,34]. The micropost stiffness is tuned solely by the height of the post, while keeping adhesive and other material bulk and surface properties constant. While these systems provide a means to show that stiffness can modulate cell function, other materials approaches will be needed to advance these studies into more complex settings, such as 3D culture.The described studies with model matrices demonstrate that bulk modulus is only one of many physical parameters that can impact how cells sense the ECM. In vivo, cells are exposed to more complex hierarchical fibrous matrices that introduce additional considerations for stiffness sensing. In contrast to uniform and mechanically isotropic hydrogels, fibrous ECM varies in structure and mechanics at the nano-, cell- and bulk scale, suggesting that signals from different cellular sensing mechanisms may be integrated to evoke a functional output. Designer ECMsTo gain a deeper mechanistic understanding of cellular stiffness sensing, the field has begun to explore materials which combine the complex physical features of natural matrices (Figure 2) with the tunability of synthetic matrices, which offer full and independent control over mechanical as well as various adhesive properties. Recently developed peptide hydrogels which undergo multi-hierarchical self-assembly [35–37], hold great promise for such applications. Gelain et al. have designed 3D self-assembling peptide nanofiber scaffolds with incorporated functional motifs for adhesion, differentiation and bone marrow homing. Adult mouse neural stem cells displayed enhanced survival without extra soluble factors [38], demonstrating the biocompatibility of such materials. In order to allow for stiffness control, Stupp and co-workers have developed peptide amphiphiles with systematically modified amino acid sequences self-assembling into nanofiber hydrogels of varying mechanical properties. By varying the number of valines and alanines present, matrix stiffness was changed [39]. However, with this approach changes in mechanics correlate with changes in the chemical structure of the building blocks, influencing peptide folding and possibly availability of incorporated biofunctional ligands. A recent report describes the design of a PEG hydrogel system with incorporated collagen mimetic peptide sequences which undergo triple helical assembly, thus serving as crosslinking sites [40]. Such a composite material offers the mechanical flexibility of synthetic PEG matrices, while adopting the nanofibrous structure of natural ECMs. Additionally, crosslinks are thermally reversible, potentially leading to materials with dynamically tunable stiffness.Open in a separate windowFigure 2Hierarchical structure of 3D fibrous matrices, leading to different levels of cellular stiffness sensing. Focal adhesion formation is impacted by the micron- (left), and integrin-mediated signalling affected by the nano-scale (right).Indeed, the availability of dynamic materials which soften or stiffen over time, via external stimuli or cell-mediated processes, enable the study of stiffness sensing in a more natural setting, as in situ changes in matrix mechanics are known to guide tissue development [41]. Matrix metalloproteinase-sensitive hydrogels allow for cell-mediated matrix cleavage and active cellular remodelling, rendering the material invasive and supportive of multicellular network formation [42–44]. In order to precisely control mechanical properties by external stimuli in the presence of cells, PEG-based photodegradable hydrogels undergoing local changes of network crosslink density upon irradiation have been developed [45]. Cells embedded within the hydrogel initially adopted a rounded morphology, but started to spread after irradiation and gel degradation. In subsequent studies, the team showed that valvular interstitial cell (VIC) activation into myofibroblasts, which only occurs on stiff substrates, can be reversed upon softening of the substrate [46]. Taking a different approach, Burdick and co-workers have fabricated methacrylate-functionalized hyaluronic acid hydrogels which are crosslinked in two sequential steps [47]. First, soft hydrogel networks are prepared using dithiothreitol as crosslinker, and variable times after cell seeding, hydrogels are further crosslinked by light. Differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) into adipocytes and osteoblasts was determined by the pre-culture period on the surface of soft hydrogels. Osteogenic differentiation was favored when gels were stiffened earlier, in contrast to gels never stiffened or stiffened later which encouraged adipogenesis, demonstrating a platform to guide stem cell fate based on dynamic changes in matrix elasticity. In a follow-up study, HA hydrogels with dynamically tunable degradation properties have been used to interrogate the mechanism underlying hMSC fate decisions in 3D environments [48]. Cell encapsulation within gels permissive or restrictive to cell-mediated degradation exhibited high and low degrees of cell spreading, correlating with high and low traction forces, resulting in favored osteogenesis versus adipogenesis, respectively. Delayed secondary covalent crosslinking after the initial cell spreading phase switched the matrix from degradable to restrictive and locked cells in a spread state, while still promoting adipogenesis. This example shows that changes in crosslinking modulate material degradability as well as 3D matrix stiffness, and that degradability effects cell fate independent of stiffness, illustrating the utility of dynamic materials to study the interplay between such parameters and cellular responses. Conclusions and future directionsDespite the wealth of literature studying cell behavior on hydrogel substrates with tunable stiffness, it is only now becoming appreciated that even the most sophisticated materials approaches to modulate stiffness also influence other physicochemical factors that themselves could impact cell function. Thus, additional challenges remain to decipher the true contribution of stiffness versus other materials properties that could be used to engineer cell behaviors. Simultaneously, an understanding of cellular mechanotransduction events in the more complex hierarchical materials of natural tissues is still lacking. In particular, future efforts will have to focus on studying how stiffness sensing occurs on different scales, as differing mechanics at various size scales is a feature intrinsic to the heterogeneous and anisotropic structure of in vivo ECM (Figure 2). With the recent development of new materials capable of structural control at the nanometer, micrometer, and bulk level, stiffness at the single integrin, focal adhesion and inter-focal adhesion scale can be tuned, potentially leading to a full hierarchical understanding of the molecular stiffness sensing process. With increasing structural complexity, it will also be important to implement molecular sensors as a feedback tool linking changes in matrix structure or conformation and intracellular response (e.g. FRET-based sensor for matrix protein folding upon cellular ECM remodelling [49]), allowing observers to follow dynamic mechanotransduction events in real time. Finally, to gain deeper insight into the role of stiffness sensing for tissue function, studies will have to probe the impact of stiffness in a broader context by incorporating additional physical and chemical factors which will likely lead to enhanced cell responses due to synergistic effects (e.g. [50]). A full study of the mechanical parameters governing cell-ECM interactions will enable the design of improved materials for tissue engineering applications, and will provide novel model systems to decipher how matrix mechanics control normal and disease physiological processes. ​                     HighlightsMechanical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) regulate cell fate

IntroductionSchool-based recess continues to draw attention as an important opportunity for both physical activity (PA) and child development outcomes. Given this, validated outcome assessments are necessary to understand what happens at recess, as well as if intervention efforts to improve the recess climate are successful. However, PA remains the primary outcome associated with recess, while often ignoring the environmental, social, and behavioral aspects of recess that might contribute to child development outcomes [1]. Previously, researchers have created observational instruments to assess levels of physical activity and social behavior at recess [2,3] however these instruments are reliant on time sampling techniques that observe one child at a time and likely miss out on larger environmental influences. More recently, Grady-Dominguez and colleagues utilized a Rasch analysis to validate an instrument that examined play sophistication during recess, however this instrument was developed specific for children with autism and intellectual disabilities [4]. To date, the only known observational instrument of recess that examines what happens at recess overall, and contains multiple constructs (e.g., environmental, social, behavioral) is the great recess framework-observational tool (GRF-OT) developed by Massey and colleagues [5].The GRF-OT contains 17 items that each describe in short detail critical aspects of the recess environment within four sub-domains: safety and structure, student behaviors, adult engagement and supervision, and transitions. Items related to safety and structure focus on the built environment, the availability of equipment and materials to support play, and the use of equipment and materials during recess. Items related to adult engagement and supervision assess the number of adults on the playground, as well as whether or not adults are supporting and engaging with students during recess. Student behavior items assess various social behaviors such as whether or not students are able to initiate and sustain their own play, solve conflicts, and the level of physical and verbal altercations. Finally, items related to transitions examine the transitions from the classroom to recess and from recess to the classroom. Response formats for all items are scores on a 1 (low quality) to 4 (high quality) rating scale, with higher scores representing higher quality markers during recess. Previous researchers [5] have established the content validity, factor structure and measurement validity, inter-rater reliability, and test-retest reliability of the GRF-OT. In doing so, it was recommended that a three-day average be used to assess recess quality, and a change score of 4.62 on the GRF-OT was needed to detect change beyond the variability expected in recess observations. Subsequent data in independent samples supported the validity of the GRF-OT, as recess sessions scoring higher on the GRF-OT also had higher levels of student engagement in play and games at recess [6]. However, these findings have been from cross-sectional data and do not support the use of the GRF-OT to track change over time. Determination of whether or not the GRF-OT is sensitive enough to detect change is a necessary step in substantiation of the monitoring and evaluation of recess. As such, the purpose of the current study was to test the responsiveness of the GRF-OT to detect changes in recess quality across a schoolyear.To determine the responsiveness of the GRF-OT, the study team collaborated with Playworks (www.playworks.org). Playworks is a non-profit organization that seeks to provide opportunities for developmentally appropriate recess for children in low-income school districts. The Playworks model of practice includes key constructs of the GRF-OT that would reasonably result in observed changes in recess quality, thereby making it an appropriate intervention to test the ability of the GRF-OT to detect change. Playworks has trained adults (i.e., “coaches”) in schools serving low-income communities who provide opportunities for students to engage in play throughout the day. By placing these adults on the playground, and training teachers to engage in recess facilitation, changes should be seen in the GRF-OT adult supervision and engagement items. Previous research has shown that total adult-student interactions, and positive adult-student interactions increase overtime with Playworks, while punishment from adults on the playground decreases over time [7]. During recesses, Playworks coaches provide equipment, lead and organize games and activities that empower students and school staff to take control of the recess environment in a positive manner. As part of the program, Playworks’ coaches also work with classroom teachers and their students during class game times, which allow for physical activity and help to establish rules, boundaries, and expectations that translate to the recess context. These changes should result in positive increases in GRF-OT items related to boundaries, availability of equipment, games, and participation in active play. Results from previous randomized controlled trials have shown higher levels of physical activity for girls [8] and minority students [9]. The Playworks program also provides student leadership opportunities through a Junior Coach leadership program where students are recruited and trained to become leaders amongst their peers. These changes should affect various student behaviors on the playground. Results of previous RCTs have shown lower levels of bullying and less transition difficulty at recess following Playworks program implementation [10,11,12]. Previous research has shown overall increases in recess quality [13] and improvements in problem solving skills over time with the Playworks program [14]. Based on these data, it was assumed that schools receiving Playworks interventions would experience positive changes in recess quality. The purpose of the study was not to asses if the Playworks program changed recess or to evaluate the program, but rather, if the GRF-OT can detect change overtime. It was hypothesized that higher positive change scores on the GRF-OT would be observed in first-year Playworks intervention schools compared to returning intervention schools and non-intervention schools. It was also hypothesized that higher positive change scores on the GRF-OT would be observed in returning intervention schools when compared to non-intervention schools. 2. Materials and Methods2.1. MethodObservational data were collected at 26 schools representing four distinct regions of the United States (Pacific Northwest (PNW), Rocky Mountains (RM), Midwest (MW), Northeast (NE)). Across the 26 schools, a standard structure to recess did not exist; rather recess schedules varied as a function of individual school schedules. On average, approximately four recess blocks were scheduled per school, per day, resulting in data being collected at 116 unique recess blocks (i.e., different children within each block). Table 1 provides school-level demographic information for each data collection site.Table 1Demographic Information and Average Change Scores of Schools.School IDRegionEnrollment Size% Racial/Ethnic Minority% Economically DisadvantagedService TypeAverage Change Scores1MW32294%84%New2.67 +2PACNW48584%95%Returning6.27 *3RM46495%97%Returning10.67 *4MW29498%95%New8.42 *5MW63047%56%New12.56 *6NE52799%71%None−7.39 **7RM47858%77%New4.608NE45797%80%New4.469RM43892%93%New6.89 *10NE63541%22%Returning−0.1711RM55988%92%None5.33 *12PACNW51280%95%New−5.81 **+13RM42818%5%Returning−2.6314MW35991%83%None−1.9015PACNW51322%46%Returning5.67 *16RM53496%95%Returning4.97 *17PACNW51859%78%New5.67 *18PACNW51569%95%New−0.86 +19RM51896%90%Returning−0.4220PACNW64252%95%New3.8021NE94186%49%New3.9222NE21890%80%New4.0023NE16383%49%None0.7824MW64396%98%Returning−0.3325NE40898%65%New1.83 +26NE52598%81%None−9.17 **Open in a separate windowNote: * Average school score indicated meaningful change. ** Average school score indicated negative change. + School reported problems with programming and was not included in main analyses.2.2. MeasuresThe GRF-OT is an observational measure that is used for live data collection during recess. Previous research has shown support for the factorial validity of a four-factor model for the GRF-OT [5]. Specifically, safety and structure of the playground, adult supervision and engagement, student behaviors, and transitions have all emerged as unique constructs within the tool. These constructs are measured through a series of questions that pertain to the context of recess and placed on a 4-point scale in which lower scores reflect lower quality scores for each item. The GRF-OT provides an overall score for recess quality on 17-items that represent the four latent constructs described above. Data collection is completed by a trained data assessor who (a) conducts an audit of the recess environment prior to recess, (b) observes live recess sessions while completing process notes for each scored item, and (c) provides an overall score for each scored item. The range of possible scores on the GRF-OT is 17 (i.e., “1” for each item) to 68 (i.e., “4” for each item). Previous data has supported the inter-rater reliability, and the test-retest stability of the GRF-OT [5]. The GRF-OT items and scoring procedures are freely available at www.greatrecessframework.org.2.3. ProceduresThis study was deemed exempt by the institutional review board providing study oversight. Data assessors were graduate students who were blinded to the study purpose and hypotheses. On two occasions, the study PI had to assist with data collection, and thus blinded, was compromised. In each case, the study PI was blinded to previous observations. Prior to data collection, all data assessors completed an online training module that documented the observational protocol and scoring system. This was followed by a one-hour workshop led by the first author in which the scoring protocol was discussed in greater depth, with various examples and scenarios provided. Training workshops were conducted face-to-face in two locations, and via video conferencing in two locations. In two study locations (one face-to-face training; one video conference training), data assessors were accompanied by expert assessors during baseline data collection to ensure adherence to scoring criteria. As our previous research has documented inter-rated reliability on the GRF-OT for trained graduate students, inter-rater reliability data were not collected in the current study. In all locations, process notes were documented by the data assessor and used to audit scoring on the GRF-OT. Data collection was completed during the first month of the academic school year, and again in the spring of the same academic year at all schools. At each time point, data assessors completed three observations of recess within a seven-day time period. The three-day average was used as the overall recess quality score in data analysis. Because schools were paying for Playworks services, intervention programming was not delayed for data collection purposes. Thus, Playworks interventions were in place during baseline data collection. Data in the current study show significant differences in baseline scores between new Playworks schools (52.13) and non-intervention schools (47.61; p = 0.001) which may suggest baseline scores were inflated in the new Playworks condition. Inflated baseline scores would make it more difficult to track change over time.Of the 26 schools that agreed to participate, 13 schools were receiving the Playworks intervention for the first time, eight schools were receiving the Playworks intervention for at least the second consecutive year, and 5 schools had requested Playworks intervention but were not receiving the intervention during the year data were collected. Following study completion, but prior to data analysis, schools were contacted to determine outside factors that may have impacted intervention effectiveness, and thus rendered them ineffective data points for determining the responsiveness to change for the GRF-OT. As a result of this, two schools were eliminated from analysis due to a change in school leadership during the data collection period (School 1, School 25). As Playworks model of intervention is predicated on investment from, and behavior change associated with school staff, a change in leadership and school priorities in-between data collection periods was seen as likely to alter the investment in recess, and thus were considered unreliable to determine how well the tool itself is able to detect change. An additional two schools were eliminated as Playworks staff noted difficulties in program implementation (School 12 and School 18). While excluded from statistical analyses, we have presented the descriptive data from these four schools in Table 1 and Table 2. Given this, the final sample for analysis included 22 schools and 97 unique recess blocks. Nine schools were receiving Playworks services for the first time (36 recess blocks), eight schools were in at least their second year of Playworks programming (39 recess blocks), and five were school receiving no recess intervention (21 recess blocks).Table 2Descriptive Data for Time 1 and Time 2 GRF-OT and GRF-OT Subscales.GRF-OT ScoreNew Playworks Schools Mean (SD)Returning Playworks Schools Mean (SD)Non-Intervention Schools Mean (SD)Schools with Identified Programming Challenges Mean (SD)Total GRF-OT Score Time 1: 52.12 (4.54)Time 1: 56.29 (5.88)Time 1: 47.61 (5.40)Time 1: 55.92 (2.96)Time 2: 57.63 (4.60)Time 2: 59.85 (2.33)Time 2: 44.52 (5.40)Time 2: 54.48 (4.90)Safety and Structure of EnvironmentTime 1: 15.32 (2.34)Time 1: 17.26 (2.04)Time 1: 14.19 (2.40)Time 1: 16.31 (1.37)Time 2: 17.59 (1.95)Time 2: 17.70 (1.09)Time 2: 13.79 (1.62)Time 2: 16.22 (1.56)Adult Engagement and SupervisionTime 1: 12.19 (2.26)Time 1: 13.43 (1.53)Time 1: 10.04 (1.13)Time 1: 12.68 (1.86)Time 2: 13.52 (1.37)Time 2: 14.07 (0.89)Time 2: 10.52 (1.45)Time 2: 12.27 (1.86)Student BehaviorsTime 1: 15.67 (1.55)Time 1: 16.18 (2.04)Time 1: 15.68 (2.02)Time 1: 16.75 (1.20)Time 2: 16.84 (1.94)Time 2: 17.66 (1.15)Time 2: 13.24 (2.71)Time 2: 16.23 (2.06)TransitionsTime 1: 5.76 (1.24)Time 1: 6.08 (1.23)Time 1: 4.64 (1.18)Time 1: 6.58 (0.83)Time 2: 6.25 (0.83)Time 2: 6.91 (0.84)Time 2: 3.92 (1.21)Time 2: 6.50 (0.87)Open in a separate window2.4. Data AnalysisData were collected to measure the responsiveness of the GRF-OT to detect change across an academic school year. To test the hypothesis that higher positive change scores on the GRF-OT would be observed in schools receiving Playworks for the first time, the magnitude of the beginning- to end-of-year change scores were calculated using Hedges’ g and 95% confidence intervals for each respective intervention group. Hedges’ g calculations were interpreted as small (≈0.20), medium (≈0.50), and large (≈0.80 or larger). Next, each individual recess block was classified as meeting or failing to meet the GRF-OT minimally detectable change (MDC) score of 4.62. A logistic regression was then conducted to examine if intervention condition was predictive of meeting the MDC. Finally, separate 3 (Group) × 2 (Time) Factorial Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) were conducted to examine different patterns of change across time for each group on the total scale and each sub-scale. GRF-OT score was entered as the dependent variable, and school and geographic region were dummy coded and entered as covariates. Effect sizes are expressed as partial eta squared, and interpreted as small (≈0.02), medium (≈0.06), and large (≈0.14 or larger). 3. ResultsAt the beginning of the school year (Time 1), the average GRF-OT score was 52.83 (3.11/4 per item) and ranged from 41 (2.41/4 per item) to 65.33 (3.84/4 per item). GRF-OT scores were lowest at non-intervention schools (Mscore = 47.61, SD = 5.40), followed by new Playworks schools (Mscore = 52.12, SD = 4.54), and returning Playworks schools (Mscore = 56.29, SD = 5.88). In the spring (Time 2), the average GRF-OT score was 55.66 (3.27/4 per item) and ranged from 33.33 (1.96/4 per item) to 67.00 (3.94/4 per item). GRF-OT scores were lowest at non-intervention schools (Mscore = 44.52, SD = 5.40), followed by new Playworks schools (Mscore = 57.63, SD = 4.60), and returning Playworks schools (Mscore = 59.85, SD = 2.33). To assess the magnitude of change from Time 1 to spring, Time 2, effect sizes were calculated using Hedge’s g for each group respectively (new Playworks, returning Playworks, no intervention). For those new to Playworks, there was a large magnitude of change detected by the GRF-OT (g = 1.19; 95% CI 0.13, 2.25). Similarly, there was a large magnitude of change detected by the GRF-OT (g = 0.788; 95% CI −0.204, 1.78) for returning Playworks schools. For those schools not receiving Playworks programming, there was a negative (i.e., GRF-OT scores decreased), moderate effect (g = −0.562; 95% CI, −2.20, 1.07).New Playworks schools were significantly more likely to meet the MDC threshold than non-intervention schools (p < 0.001; Odds Ratio = 21.59; 95% CI 4.27, 109.15). Returning Playworks schools were also significantly more likely to meet the MDC threshold than non-intervention schools (p = 0.014; Odds Ratio = 7.34; 95% CI 1.50, 35.95). Average change scores for each school can be seen in Table 1. There was a significant difference in baseline scores between intervention schools that met versus did not meet the MDC threshold (p < 0.001). Schools that did not meet the MDC threshold had higher baseline recess quality scores (57.97) as compared to schools that met the MDC (51.40).Finally, results of the three (new intervention, returning intervention, non-intervention) × 2 (beginning of year, end of year) ANCOVA showed a significant interaction effect (p < 0.001; partial eta squared = 0.328), indicating a significantly different pattern of change across the three groups. As shown in both Table 2 and Figure 1, recess sessions with Playworks intervention increased their GRF-OT score throughout the year, whereas those with no intervention decreased their GRF-OT score. A similar pattern of results was observed for individual sub-scales of the GRF-OT. As can be seen in Figure 2, when controlling for both school, and region, a differential pattern of change was detected between the three intervention groups for safety and structure (p < 0.001; partial eta squared = 0.341), adult engagement and supervision (p = 0.072; partial eta squared = 0.056), student behaviors (p < 0.001; partial eta squared = 0.207), and transitions (p = 0.011; partial eta squared = 0.095).Open in a separate windowFigure 1Group by time interaction of Great Recess Framework-Observational Tool (GRF-OT) scores show that recess sessions with Playworks programming increased their GRF-OT score throughout the year, while those with no programming decreased their GRF-OT score.Open in a separate windowFigure 2Group by time interaction shows a differential pattern of change was detected between the three intervention groups for the four GRF sub-scales; safety and structure, adult engagement and supervision, student behaviors, and transitions. 4. DiscussionThe purpose of the current study was to test the responsiveness of the GRF-OT to detect meaningful changes in recess quality across a schoolyear. There was a large magnitude of positive change detected for first year Playworks intervention schools, as well as returning Playworks intervention schools. Moreover, a moderate negative magnitude of change was detected for schools that were not receiving an intervention, suggesting that recess quality may diminish across the schoolyear. Each of the four GRF-OT sub-scales, (1) safety and structure, (2) adult engagement and supervision, (3) student behaviors, and (4) transitions were also shown to be responsive to change, as demonstrated by the differential patterns across intervention types. It should be noted that adult engagement and supervision sub-scale was not significantly different between groups when controlling for school and region, however a moderate effect was observed.Previous research [5,6] has established the reliability and validity of the GRF-OT, however the current study makes a unique contribution to the literature in examining the responsiveness of this tool to detect change over time. While levels of PA continue to be the primary outcome measure associated with school-based recess, understanding how recess may contribute to the social development of children necessitates a more holistic means of evaluation of this context. Notably, if children are active in an environment that includes high levels of bullying and anti-social behavior, it is likely that PA alone will not contribute positively to their social development [15]. Moreover, research has shown children’s experiences of recess differ greatly, and may be effected by equity of space and equipment use [16], gender [17], adult engagement [7], and social status [18]. Thus, comprehensive and thorough evaluation of how the environment shapes various outcomes is paramount to understanding how recess contributes to the health and wellbeing of children in schools. As initiatives driven by the CDC and SHAPE America include the ongoing monitoring and assessment of recess as a necessary strategy for healthy schools, the GRF-OT is a reliable, valid and now evidence-based responsive tool that is freely available as a resource for schools to consider in this process. 5. Limitations and Directions for Future ResearchDespite a positive contribution to the literature, the current study is not without limitations. First, aside from situations in which interventions may have been ineffective (e.g., administrative changes), assessment of perceived changes in the recess environment were not examined. Future research should consider key stakeholders’ perceptions of recess changes (e.g., students, teachers, administration) and compare these data to changes observed using the GRF-OT. Moreover, including additional timepoints, as opposed to just the beginning and end of the school year, would allow for examination of whether or not the GRF-OT can detect more subtle changes over time. Another limitation to the current study is that true baseline data for intervention schools was not possible, as Playworks begins their program at the beginning of the academic school year. Thus, at intervention schools, Time 1 data collection was in the early phases of the Playworks intervention. This could possibly explain why intervention schools had higher baseline scores than non-intervention schools and might also under-estimate the magnitude of change detected by the GRF-OT. Indeed, analysis showed those with higher baseline scores were less likely to meet the threshold of the MDC, which may indicate a ceiling effect for the GRF-OT. Finally, it should be noted that the current study assessed whether the GRF-OT could detect change within a recess intervention that provided a more structured recess environment, and it is unclear as to whether or not change would be detected in other forms of intervention (e.g., the introduction of loose parts or playground marking to encourage play).In considering a future line of research using the GRF-OT, data examining how recess quality affects children’s physical activity, social-emotional development, classroom behavior and academic performance are important to understand the impacts of recess quality. At this time, both observational and experimental studies are needed to better understand this relationship, thereby informing policy decisions around recess. 6. ConclusionsAs efforts to monitor and evaluate recess outcomes and contexts become increasingly important for school compliance and public policy decisions, access to an instrument that can assess the quality of the recess environment and is able to detect change in quality over time is imperative. This study adds to the literature by providing a valid, reliable, and change-sensitive measure for use in future research on school-based recess. The results of this study suggest the GRF-OT is a responsive instrument that can be used by schools, practitioners, and policy makers to assess the quality of the recess environment.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/33214738/,"IntroductionCurrently, telecom fraud has become an increasingly serious crime, which “affects social stability and the sense of security of the public” [49]. For the purpose of possessing other people’s property illegally, criminals fabricate false discourse and set up scams through landline phone, cellphone or other Internet communication tools to commit remote frauds against victims, seriously infringing on the people’s legitimate rights and interests.The scientific research on telecom frauds has achieved a lot since the end of last century. On the one hand, the early research achievements on telecom fraud was mainly as follows, the introduction to telecom fraud [32], the categorization of telecom fraud [9–11], causes and consequences of telecom fraud [23], suitability of relevant laws and regulations [1], and the technological development in banks and telecommunications companies for the prevention on telecom fraud [12]. On the other hand, with the development of internet and online communication, the research is increasingly focused on the novelty of telecom fraud, such as the approaches to the computer-aided identification of telecom frauds [42], the improvement of relevant laws to promote the establishment of law enforcement system and administrative supervision system to prevent and combat telecom fraud [47], the joint investigation and control mechanism among banks, judicial bodies and telecommunications companies [45], the mechanism of international cooperation on the prevention and punishment and the judicial assistance mechanism [24].Till now, the linguistic research on telecom fraud focuses remarkably on email frauds. Chiluwa [8] has made a computer-mediated analysis of discourse structures and functions of emails, which reveals that the email writers apply discourse/pragmatic strategies such as socio-cultural greeting formulas, self-identification, reassurance/confidence building, narrativity and action prompting strategies to sustain the receivers’ interest. Freiermuth [18] has analyzed the scammers’ intention behind each rhetorical move that exists in email messages. Onyebadi and Park [33] have examined the framing of email communications used in the frauds, with the findings indicating that the scammers used Realism as the main persuasive lexical characteristic in the messages.However, much more importance needs to be attached to the research on cellphone fraud discourse. Firstly, a great number of telecom frauds are implemented through cellphone interactions and false discourse information is always transmitted via cellphones in those crimes [27]. In the fraud interactions, language use has much deeper influence on fraudsters’ identity construction [50] and language interpretation produces a certain social identity in communications [31]. Thus, it is necessary to explore how cellphone fraudsters shape their false identities through their language use and victims’ language interpretation. Secondly, there are two major means of cellphone frauds, one is seductive deception and the other is threatening deception. It is emphasized that the process of “seduction” and “deception” cannot do without activities of speech communication [50], but the process of “threatening” and “deception”, especially threats constructed through discursive strategies in cellphone frauds, has not been touched in any studies. Thirdly, since asymmetrical roles or unequal positions exist between fraudsters and victims in telecom fraud interactions [49], it is needed to investigate the roles fraudsters’ threatening language plays in the distribution of power and control.Threat, from a social perspective, focuses extensively on speakers’ communicative intentions to frighten victims and influence their behaviors [7]. Threat in some research has been regarded as a speech act performed in threatening discourse [40, 44]. Special attention has always been paid to direct threats and indirect ones [17, 20], in which required conditions have been provided for defining the speech act of making a threat [44]. However, there is still no clear-cut between direct and indirect threats. Instead of the binary contrasts, Muschalik [30] has therefore proposed a scalar approach to illustrate the degree of different threats, which offers the possibility to do quantitative linguistic study of threat. From the interpersonal angle, Gales [19] has revealed threateners’ convey of interpersonal meanings through rhetorical strategies and their stance-taking in threatening discourse. All the previous studies have provided references for the macro-analysis of threatening language in fraud interactions. Other studies concentrate on semantic meanings of threats [21, 48] or word choices [30]. The former research offers “the basic structure of the threats uses a conditional logic: if the recipient continues problem action/does not initiate required action then negative consequences will be produced by the speaker.” [21], which is consistent with Sacks’ [39] discussion on warning/threat as an initiating action in an adjacency pair. The latter categorizes the verbs used for threats into violent, ambiguous or non-violent, with four sub-types of violent verbs [30]. These studies demonstrate that threatening language can be investigated from lexical, syntactic and semantic aspects.In spite of the above-mentioned research on threats or the language used for making threats, the threatening language in cellphone fraud interactions has been touched in very few empirical studies so far. Taking the specific contexts in cellphone frauds into consideration, the meanings of threats may be constructed in different ways, which is of significance to explore from the linguistic aspect.In accordance with the literatures above, threatening language, as the working definition here, can be defined in such a broad sense as the discourse, utterance or speech used by speakers to perform direct or indirect threats to and impose psychological pressure on listeners for achieving certain communicative objectives. Threat can be defined that an action, detrimental to listeners, is constructed or performed through language used by speakers. For the purpose of more convenient distinction in the present study, victims’ fully exposure to the threatening or bullying languages will be discussed as direct threat while indirect ones are constituted in implicitly stated threatening or bullying languages that still exert much pressure over victims. In cellphone frauds, threatening language is used by fraudsters in the fraud interactions, which constructs threat to victims and bring the victims with huge psychological pressure into the cellphone traps.Therefore, the present paper presents a discursive psychological analysis of Chinese cellphone fraud interactions, focusing on the ways in which fraudsters use threatening language to help carry out remote frauds. Discursive Psychology and Conversation AnalysisDiscursive Psychology: Theoretical BasisDiscursive psychology (DP), different from traditional psychology that separate mental activities from external behaviors, is a perspective for studying discourse as social practice, with mental activities and external behaviors integrated [28]. The three core principles of DP are: discourse is both constructed and constructive, discourse is situated within a social context, and discourse is action-orientated [16, 46].DP treats language, with cellphone fraudsters’ discourse no exception, as constructed and constructive. DP takes a relativist, social constructionist stance to knowledge [46]. To say that cellphone fraudsters’ discourse is constructed, it is necessary to analyze the way fraudsters speak to the victims and to explore how particular aspects of frauds as event are constructed and whether the fraud effects in cellphone interactions are achieved. Discourse is simultaneously constructive of a particular version of reality through the choice of “particular words formulations over others” [41] or “of different versions of the world, through the way in which we talk about people, events, actions and organizations ([46]: 10)”. Thus, DP can be employed to examine how fraudsters create false realities or build their certain false identities by their language use as a policeman, a bank clerk, or a gang member, and so on to threaten and entrap victims.In DP, discourse is situated within a social context in that DP is a theoretical and analytical approach that treats talk and text as social action rather than representation, and talk and text are argued to accomplish actions in the social world [46]. That is, discourse is action-oriented in an interactional context and the action orientation of language highlights how people use language to do things and to reach their certain purposes [4] or to get things done [35]. An example is a piece of cellphone talk between a fraudster and a victim, in which the fraudster’s discourse performs an action as defrauding in the interaction. The fraudster’s statement “Your son is with me.” To respond with the question “What’s your ransom demand?”, the victim treats it as his son being kidnapped. The fraudster’s statement relates to the performative nature of language, i.e. he does things with language [16].A discursive psychological approach is also ethnomethodologically-oriented [15]. Firstly, DP was developed within psychology but is influenced by linguistics, philosophy, sociology, post-structuralism, ethnomethodology and conversation analysis (CA), in which psychology as an object to be analyzed for how it is made consequential in social interaction [46]. “Discursive psychologists examine the performative qualities of descriptions as part of action sequences in real life talk. This interest can be traced back directly to the influence of conversation analysts. Conversation-analytic studies demonstrate that what people do with language” ([29]: 2). Secondly, turns at talk in specific cellphone fraud contexts are to be understood by both fraudsters and victims within the sequence organizations, and “we can examine the situatedness of the talk in terms of the turn-by-turn interaction. ([46]: 13)” Therefore, it is essential to investigate how fraudsters treat their turn-taking by applying the “next-turn proof procedure” ([25]: 15). Thirdly, DP research is mostly concerned with how such psychological concepts as desires or fears that underpin conversations and interactions, in various particular settings [15]. It is corresponding to the idea that ethnomethodology “aims to understand the methods, through which people make sense of each other’s practices in everyday settings: how people make sense of what they are doing. ([46]: 243)”In addition, since online spoken interaction as a form of talk in its own right needs much more attention [29], DP has also been employed to study online discourse as a social practice [41]. Accordingly, DP offers a new methodological path in this study, for the exploration of cellphone fraud interactions, one form of online interactions.Conversation Analysis: Analytical ToolCA is an approach to analyzing natural discourse that examines sequential organizations and action-orientation of talk-in-interaction [46]. More specifically speaking, CA is concerned with every social conduct or action in various natural communication contexts [34].Historically, since its derivation from ethnomethodology and sociolinguistics, CA has been closer to DP in approach and regarded ethnomethodologically the sociology as a theoretical or methodological resource [35]. CA conventions have recently and increasingly been used for discursive psychological study of the natural interactions recorded and transcribed.Theoretically, CA focuses on the structures and organizations of talk and on how social actions are constructed through the careful language use. It is commonly known that CA starts with “talk in interaction”. CA attends “to understand the mechanics of interaction ([46]: 36)” and “the ways in which participants’ talk is oriented to the practical concerns of social interaction [3]”, such as how a conversation begins, how assessments are made, and how refusals or offers are completed, and “how descriptions, accounts, and categories in conversation are put together to perform specific actions [3].” For example, since threats in adjacency pairs have largely been ignored in the conversation analytic literature for many years [21], it is can be examined that fraudsters attend to their fraudulent gains and accountability in threatening fraud interactions.Methodologically, CA provides a useful analytical tool for DP. Turn-taking systems, sequence organizations, overall structural organization of the interaction, lexical choice, and so on have been identified as important domains of interactional phenomena [13, 22]. Firstly, as the fundamental units, turns are designed carefully or carelessly, intentionally or unintentionally in the sequence organizations. Repetition, interruption, self-corrections, pause within a turn, and overlapping parts between turns are often analyzed in social interaction. Secondly, lexical choice is also important in the language use for the action achievements. Thirdly, it is typical in CA that suprasegmental elements and details in transcripts such as length of pauses, prolonged syllables, pitches, loudness and some other prosodic features have been widely accepted to be relevant parameters for conversation [3, 37] in that the information is conveyed about speakers’ emotional states or “attitude toward the topic under discussion ([26]: 26)”.“DP draws on many of the tools of CA, including focusing on turn-taking and sequential organization, but rather than starting with social actions, DP focuses first on a specific psychological issue or the production of categories in talk. ([46]: 44)” Here, CA is employed as a useful analytical tool for the study of some cellphone fraud interactions, starting with fraudsters’ and victims’ different mental states. MethodologyData CollectionIn this paper, 20 pieces of cellphone conversations in the authentic fraud cases are collected from Chinese media. To protect privacy, the police and telecommunications companies have just provided parts of those cellphone call recordings. The media have only released some typical audio clips for legal news reports or public legal education on the fight against telecom frauds, the mainstream news media including CCTV (China Central Television), Chinanews, Tencent, Sohu, Sina and so on. In these clips, there are 6340 seconds for fraudster-victim’s conversation and 750 seconds for the police’s and reporters’ comments. Specifically speaking, the legal opinions on these cases have been included in the videos or audios, or in the corresponding hypertexts, warning people not to fall into the cellphone fraud or conducting legal education. The links of the videos or audios, and the corresponding news titles or hypertexts are listed in “Appendix 2” for the convenience of searching.To ensure validity and reliability, two raters have firstly confirmed fraudsters’ threatening language in the authentic cellphone frauds. When the results do not match, the discrepancy has been resolved through negotiation. Secondly, the typical cases have been categorized to figure out fraudsters’ false identities as policemen in 14 cases, procurator, telecom staff or gang leader in other 6 cases respectively. Thirdly, direct or indirect threats in the data have been classified and different conversation skills used in the threatening language are counted. Fourthly, threat clauses have been segmented with Praat 6.1.13 [6], and the numbers of repetitions, interruptions and syllables with supersegmented features are also counted. At last, in these cases, some victims have been cheated and even transferred money to the fraudsters, others have recognized the frauds or been successfully stopped by the police from transferring their money. We have extracted and analyzed some pieces of the conversations between the fraudsters and the victims, in which their names or nicknames have been anonymized and the ID numbers or phone numbers involved have been omitted partially for privacy protection.Research QuestionsThe main aim of DP is to examine how psychological constructs are enacted and made relevant in interaction and the implications of these for social practices, while that of CA is to examine social actions and the sequential and organizational features of talk that accomplish these actions. Both DP and CA are predominantly used with video or audio recordings in social interactions. These issues could be tackled from a DP and CA perspective, specifically in relation to accountability and fact construction. For CA, the interaction itself needs “to be the focus of analysis”, and “provides a rich source of data” ([46]: 38) of fraudster–victim interaction.Therefore, the present study aims to venture into cellphone fraud discourse by analyzing how fraudsters use language to construct the actions of threat and examining how they employ discursive strategies to accomplish these actions in the Chinese cellphone fraud interactions. Based on the three fundamental principles of DP, i.e. discourse is constructed constructive, action-oriented, and situated, three questions will be answered in the present study:How are fraudsters’ false identities constructed in the threatening fraud interactions?What conversational skills are used by fraudsters to trigger victims’ psychological panic?How are fraudsters’ discursive practices situated to account for the threatening actions?Data AnalysisDP is drawn upon to conduct a data-based qualitative analysis of the interactional features [41] of natural fraudster-victim talks. On the one hand, some extracts are taken as examples for discourse analysis to demonstrate fraudsters’ false identity construction, conversational skills and discursive situations. On the other hand, we will make statistical analysis of fraudsters’ different conversational skills used in specific situations. Data analysis starts with data transcript and data coding based on CA conventions (see “Appendix 1”). To answer the first question, we will explicate the way in which fraudsters bring victims into discursive sequence and psychological interactions through turn-taking design. For the second question, we will analyze the conversational features in fraudsters’ threatening language such as stress, loudness, tempo, interruption and repetition. And the third question will be answered in the discussion of fraudsters’ discursive practices at both micro-level and macro-level. Fraudsters’ False Identities Constructed in Cellphone InteractionsDiscourse is constructed in the social interactions in that in a certain sequential order turn-taking promotes discourse development from inner-sentence and inter-sentence levels to global-discourse level [14]. Through turn-taking design, cellphone fraudsters bring victims into discursive sequences in threatening fraud interactions. The fact that discourse is constructed is embodied through the way in which fraudsters speak to victims and the fraud effects on victims.Information Gaps in Sequence OrganizationsAs action is oriented, discourse is also constructive in the situated context. In the data, fraudsters’ turn-taking design often intentionally constructs false identities with threatening language and entrap their preys, resulting from information gaps between victims and them in the interactions. For example,Case 07 is collected from CCTV News report on fraud with the title “遭遇匿名电话威胁 实为电信诈骗新招 (Threatened by an Anonymous Phone Call A New Way for Telecom Fraud)”. In Extract 1 of Case 07 (00:23-01:18),1 the fraudster constructs the fearful and frightening events through the new information from Lines 1–3 in the first turn, in which he chooses the scary words like “黑道 (gangdom)”, “砍掉 (cut off)” and “残 (disabled)” to make the direct threat in full function, i.e. a threatened future action detrimental to the victim [40]. However, the victim’s response “我没得罪什么人啊? (I haven’t offended anyone?)” shows that he is confused at the fraudster’s words because the information gap between them has been created. In order to achieve his purpose effectively, the fraudster then changes the turn to tell the victim intentionally and sequentially about his fictional experiences in Lines 8-10, using such a clause with the frightening meaning as “干的就是刀尖舔血的活 (what we do for living always depends on licking blood on the tip of the knife)”. It is the new information of an indirect threat that results in the victim’s nervousness, and even scare and panic. In the interaction, the information gap appears between the fraudster’s information surplus and the victim’s information vacancy [14]. The fraudster’s false identity has been constructed as a gang leader in the adjacency pair in Lines 12–13, in which the victim’s belief in the speaker’s ability to act and intention to act [17] can be proved by the victim’s “谢谢您,谢谢您! (Thank you, thank you!)”.Fraudsters may often fabricate victims’ criminal evidence to create information gaps, i.e. one of victims’ bank cards involving financial crimes, so that the fictitious crime can get in touch with the bank card and pave the way for fraudsters to elicit victims’ bank card information, balances, passwords, verification codes and so on. In Case 05, the cellphone fraudsters were caught and brought from Indonesia to China by Shanghai Police, reported on “澎湃新闻 (The Paper)”. According to the report, those fraudsters have set a three-line cellphone working group in the whole fraud process. The phone team in the first line poses as “customer service”, such as bank staff, water or gas company clerk, to inform their victims that they have overdue bills, conclude that the victims’ identities have been illegally used, and then transfer the phone to the second line. In the second line fraudsters will play as “police” to inform the victims that they have been involved in some serious crimes, and the impersonated police then lead their victims to a third-line “prosecutor”. The false prosecutor guides the victims to deposit the money into an account designated by them to complete the fraud.In Extract 2 of Case 05 (00:00–02:23), the fraudster takes money laundering as the main topic in the threatening discourse development. He constructs the turn that the victim’s bank card is involved in a money laundering case in Lines 1–2, and then interrogates the victim “这到底是怎么一回事啊? (What the hell is going on?)” in a policeman’s implicitly threatening voice. In that turn, the fraudster finishes two processes in turn-taking system, i.e. turn-construction component and turn-allocation component [38]. In the adjacency pair, the victim responds immediately to the fraudster’s turn allocation to deny her crime with a high-speed expression “>我没有呀 < (> I’m not <)” in Line 3. As a matter of fact, the new information about the so-called criminal case has frightened the victim and the information gap has brought her to the edge of the fraud trap because she has expressed her worry about the case and her willing to go to the police station in Lines 3–5. As the analysis shows, the victim’s response seems to be predicted by the fraudster as he has made both direct and indirect threats in Lines 6–8 to impose much more psychological pressure on the victim and even to control her entirely. For the one point, the fraudster uses the clause “你人肯定是要过来的 (you are sure to come)” to construct an indirect threat in the specific situation alongside the victim’s words; for the other reason, in the new turn the fraudster strengthens his false police identity as well as frightens the victim by the direct threat “…你现在的身份已经被列为嫌疑人了, 检察长都要来逮捕你了 (…you have now been identified as a suspect, the chief procurator is coming to arrest you)”.After the success of eliciting the victim’s some information and exercising mental control over the victim, the fraudster changes to another turn in Lines 9–12 to reinforce the fact that the victim’s bank card is regarded as a money laundering tool under her name, with a large amount of money, i.e. 2.18 million RMB involved. However, the victim is still unwilling to give up her innocence in the next turn in Lines 13–16. The fraudster threatens the victim directly again by the four clauses in the following turn in Lines 17–18, which have resulted in the victim’s extreme panic and her cry on the phone. In accordance with the “well-prepared and elaborately-designed ‘phone script’” [49], the information gap between the fraudster and the victim has constructed the fraudster’s police identity successfully and tricked the victim’s discourse smoothly and sequentially into the fraudulent discourse development, which has been demonstrated by the victim’s “我相信你 (I believe you)” in Line 22.Information Sharing in Sequence OrganizationsExcept for the false identity construction through information gaps, fraudsters can also invoke their false identities based on information sharing with victims in the specific sequences, in which much pressure is exerted on victims although threats are always made indirectly.Fraudsters transmits victims’ personal information gathered illegally to victims, sharing the fact information with them. It is the first key step for a cellphone fraud sequence that fraudsters possess victims’ personal information and can speak out victims’ names, ID numbers and home addresses accurately on the phone. Consequently, the victims are easy to trust the fraudsters so that the fraudsters may succeed in their false identities constructed with the indirect threatening language. For example, Case 08 has been reported on CCTV 13 and been confirmed as a cellphone fraud case, in which the fraudster uses the prepared fraud scripts to play a role as a gang leader and pretends that he can order his gang members to do something harmful to his victims. In Extract 3 from Case 08 (00:24–00:42), the fraudster in Line 2 has spoken of the victim’s native place “衡水枣强 (Zaoqiang, Hengshui)” accurately and emphasized in Line 3 that the hometown is there, aiming to tell the victim that “I have got your detailed personal information based on our investigation”. Then the fraudster says in a much more threatening clause in the new turn in Lines 4 and 5 to strengthen the sharing information above. The fraudster uses information sharing to construct his false identity as a gang leader, triggering the victim’s fear.Sometimes fraudsters construct their false identities as staff in government departments to deceive victims. Case 20 is reported on Tencent and Sina as follows: on 3rd March 2020, Anti-fraud Center of Beijing Daxing District Public Security Bureau released a recording of a cellphone fraud related to the COVID-19 epidemic, in which a woman victim suddenly received a phone call about her illegal sales of masks and the fraudster gradually introduced her into a trap.In Line 1 of Extract 4 from Case 20 (00:02–00:55), the fraudster introduces his identity as a staff in Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control to gain the victim’s trust. Following the fraudster’s warning statement in the next turn about illegal sales of masks, the victim casts a little doubt with the turn “我不清楚 (I don’t know)” on the fraudster’s indirect threat. The fraudster then asks the victim to confirm the so-called buyer’s personal information, i.e. whether 130*** is the victim’s ID number. After the victim’s confirmation and based on the sharing ID number, the fraudster changes to a new turn in Lines 7 and 8 about the victim’s violation of “《突发公共卫生事件应急条例》第52条的规定 (Article 52 of Regulation on the Urgent Handling of Public Health Emergencies)”. It means that the woman should be investigated for criminal responsibility according to the law. Consequently, the woman victim begins to be panic, and the fraudster has reinforced his false identity and put the victim under much mental pressure.In summary, fraudsters, through turn-taking designs, make full use of information gaps or sharing information to construct false identities. In the process of fraudulent discourse development, fraudsters carry out direct or indirect threats to victims, and allows victims to enter their preset discursive sequences and psychological interactions. Fraudsters’ Conversational Skills to Trigger Victims’ PanicRepetition and InterruptionRepetition, one of conversational skills, bears emphasized or other rhetorical effect in conversations [43]. Thus, except for scary words or clauses for threatening victims directly, fraudsters use repetition to manipulate victims’ speech, and even threaten victims directly or indirectly to trigger their panic. For example,In Extract 2, the fraudster repeats his threatening utterance to deal with the victim’s three requests to go to the police station for the justification of her innocence. When the victim asks to go to the police station for the first time, the fraudster replies with the clause “检察长都要来逮捕你了 (the chief procurator is coming to arrest you)” in a direct threatening tone. For a second time, the fraudster tries to increase the pressure on the victim with a similar repetitive threatening expression “你是要被立马性地拘捕的 (you will be arrested immediately)” in a much louder sound. For a third time, when the victim mentions to go to the station with a crying sound, the fraudster uses a direct threat consisting of a future action [20] by himself “我现在叫人把你带到看守所 (I’ll have you taken to jail now)” in a much louder and more terrible voice to further threaten the victim, and with the word “现在 (now)” to construct a false immediate reality. The word choices also demonstrate that the fraudster’s repetition skill has put increasing pressure on the victim and further constructed the fraudster’s false police identity and the fact that the victim is involved in a money laundering case. The fraudster’s repetition has achieved at least two communication goals, one is for the victim’s trust in his police identity, the other is for his refusal of the victim’s request.As another conversational skill, interruption may be used by fraudsters to restrict turn allocations to victims in the threatening fraud interactions. Sacks et al. [38] discussed transition relevance places (TRPs) in the turn-taking system, and interruption might occur, if a speaker does not produce his words at TRPs. Victims’ speech may be interrupted and controlled by fraudsters and victims’ psychological pressure and panic may be aggravated indirectly by the unbalanced and unequal discursive power. Take Case 01 from Chinanews website as an example, in which the fraudster is constantly changing means to deceive the victim into handing over money.In Extract 5 of Case 01 (00:33–01:01), the fraudster contacts the victim who transferred some money to him several days ago. In the first turn, the woman victim asks why she could not get through to the fraudster’s cellphone the day before, and she tries to know how her money transferred last time helps deal with the criminal case involved her. But the fraudster continues in Lines 2–3 to deceive the victim that he was on duty to catch the accomplices involved. In the next turn in Line 4, the victim wants to get some information on her money, but her utterance “你是 (Are you)” has been interrupted by the fraudster. On the one hand, the interruption has disrupted the victim’s thought about the inquiry of her money, resulting in the victim’s repetition of her own expression “我说你抓到了没有嘛? (I said if you’ve caught them?)” in Line 6. On the other hand, the fraudster can take control of the victim again for his ongoing deception action or prepared threatening fraud scripts. Consequently, until the last turn in Line 8 can the victim get the chance to inquire about her money.Suprasegmental SkillsAs one of relevant acoustic parameters for conversation analysis, prosody includes suprasegmental elements of speech such as pitch, intensity, prolonged sounds, speech rate and so on [37]. Fraudsters talk on the phone to trigger victims’ panic by prosodic designs in threatening fraud interactions. The acoustic analyses such as pitch or intensity for the present study are conducted with Praat 6.1.16 [6].The cellphone conversation in Case 04 reported on the Kankanews has been collected by the police from one of the fraudsters’ recording pens. The reporter uses the typical conversation to tell people how a phone caller, before whom there is only a phone, a piece of paper and a pen, becomes as a “a best actor or actress” as a phone fraudster and teach people how to take care of their own money bags.In Extract 6 of Case 04 (01:13–01:23), the victim doubts whether the money from her debit card will be transferred to a certain fraudster’s account rather than to the police’s, and the fraudster uses prosodic skill to control the victim. The two words “怎么 (How)” and “会 (could)” in the fraudster’s question step sharply up to a higher pitch, with the pitch movements visualized in the frequency analysis in Fig. 1. The rising pitch movements and the two pitch peaks serve as a cue to the emphasized meanings [37], one is for questioning the victim rhetorically, the other for telling the victim an obvious answer “I am a policeman in the station”.Open in a separate windowFig. 1Rising pitch contour of two rhetorical CHAs“Prominence is achieved through an increase in loudness and pitch ([37]: 6)”, so the fraudster simultaneously raises his voice in uttering the two characters “(怎)么 (How)” and “会 (could)” with the intensities of “么” and “会” taking on the upward trend in Fig. 2. In the speech, the fraudster attempts to express his angry in much louder voice for the same rhetorical purpose of putting the victim in fear.Open in a separate windowFig. 2Rising intensity contour of two rhetorical CHAsThe fraudster’s higher pitch and rising intensity create another type of indirect threat, which produce much more serious effect, as the victim immediately responds with a clause “是一样的号码 (Yeah, it’s the same number)” for the interactional alignment with the fraudster.In Case 03, the cellphone fraud news reported on GRT Satellite Channel, a victim has been cheated of 500,000 RMB. Although the old method of impersonating a policeman has been used, it has also been integrated with new tricks by the fraudster.In Extract 7 of Case 03 (01:00–01:18), the “if–then” construction can be identified as a direct threat [21], in which the fraudster also threatens the victim by means of rising intensity of some key words and syllables. It can be shown in Fig. 3 that the intensities of the five characters “及刑事拘捕 (arrested on a criminal charge)” take on five increasing peaks and a rising contour as a whole. This example of intensity matching occurs in the fraudulent sequence, in which the fraudster directly threatens the victim by raising his voice when the victim, in spite of nervousness, begins to doubt the fraudster’s false police identity and hesitates to do as the fraudster asks.Open in a separate windowFig. 3Rising intensity contour of five rhetorical CHAsIn the fraud process of Case 16, the news about impersonating the police reported on JSBC (Jiangsu Broadcasting Corporation), fraudsters expand all kinds of tricks to make their victims panic. But the purpose remains the same, to ask victims to transfer money. The news hostess suggests that all of us polish eyes when receiving a similar call, keep calm firstly, ignore kinds of threats, and directly call 110 to verify any possible question.“Time is realized in the form of duration, tempo, speech rate, rhythm and pause ([37]: 3)”. In Extract 8 of Case 16 (01:52–02:43), the fraudster firstly slows his speech to tell the victim that he is involved in a serious criminal case of drug trafficking and money laundering. In order to further the threat directly, the fraudster then uses an alternative question in a new turn “现在是你要自己来投案自首,  > 还是我们开警车去逮你啊? < (Now you come to the police to confess, > or we drive a police car to arrest you? <)”. In the second part of the question, the sudden faster speech forces the victim to make a choice immediately. But it is difficult for the victim to respond because a typical alternative question needs a mutually exclusive answer [5]. Alternative questions boost some functional features in cognition, such as to introduce listeners’ thinking about the answer, listeners’ reflection on something or listeners’ idea on something. Thus, no matter which one to choose, the victim is unwilling to face either of the two terrible situations, not to mention the action that the police come to arrest him. Thus, the victim’s fear has been heightened.When the victim questions the fraudster’s description with the turn in Line 7, the fraudster has changed the topic to a so-called more complicated matter in the next turn in Lines 9–10, i.e. the victim’s possible personal information leakage and definite identity as a criminal suspect. So, in Line 11, the fraudster then tells the victim that he has to cooperate with the police. At the end of this turn in Line 12, the fraudster suddenly raises his pitch (see Fig. 4) to order the victim to contact the so-called “国家银联管理中心 (National Unionpay Management Center)”. Here the pitch contours of the Chinese characters “现在必须马上 (now must immediately)” are much higher than those preceding or following ones, in which “现在 (now)” and “马上 (immediately)” are used to urge the victim to take action without delay, and “必须 (must)” for the tone of an order. Here the fraudster aims to directly exert much more psychological pressure over the victim and further control of the victim’s action.Open in a separate windowFig. 4Much higher pitch contour of rhetorical CHAsIn summary, fraudsters often make timely choices of conversation skills such as repetition, interruption, louder voice, sudden pitch rising or speeding up utterance in threatening fraud interactions. And fraudsters attempt to cause victims’ psychological panic in threatening tones, in which victims may thoroughly believe their troubles in crimes or may be forced into fraud traps. Fraudsters’ Discursive Practices Situated for the Threatening ActionsFraudsters’ Discursive Devices Used in Preconceived SituationsSince “in methodological terms, the discourse can be analyzed for how it is put together to perform activities [36]”, fraudsters show their unique discursive devices which have been prepared and designed scripts in preconceived situations.“DP is concerned with discourse in social interaction and how it is constructed to accomplish particular actions in specific contexts ([46]: 8)”. The statistical analysis here has fully demonstrated that fraudsters use direct and indirect threats of clauses to have victims being forced to be entrapped. It can be seen in Table 1 that 266 threat clauses in the twenty audio clips are indirect ones, accounting for 79.4% of the total, and 69 direct ones, taking only up 20.6%. The categorization of threats has also revealed how those threatening languages work in the interaction (see examples in Table 1). Fraudsters always construct a disquieting situation through indirect threats especially at the beginning of cellphone conversation while they suppress victims with direct threats in a pinch, resulting in victims’ psychological defense collapsed. According to the comments from CCTV news in Case 14, the 3-h cellphone fraud conversation is recorded by the fraudster herself simultaneously for use as a training book, following a carefully prepared script. Indirect threats are used at the first step to win victims’ trust, and then fraudsters begin to terrify and control their victims in forceful, harsh and direct threatening tones.Table 1Fraudsters’ direct and indirect threatsTypes of threats (clauses)ExamplesFreq.%Direct threats“要逮到你了, 我就割你的舌头 (If I catch you, I’ll cut off your tongue.)”(07:28–07:31 in Case 11)“要先行拘留你45天 (You will be held in detention for 45 days.)”(02:28–02:30 in Case 14)6920.6Indirect threats“你今天涉及到的案例叫做刘**案件 (The case you’re involved in today is called Liu** Case)” (00:00–00:02 in Case 09)“现在确实有一部北京的手机号登记在您的名下, 并且涉及到了诈骗的违法行为 (Now here is indeed a Beijing cellphone number registered in your name, and involved in the fraud.)”(00:10–00:18 in Case 10)26679.4Total335100Open in a separate windowAt the micro-level, the integrity of conversational skills is often used by fraudsters for trapping victims in prepared discursive sequences. Table 2 below shows the frequencies of four types of conversational skills used in fraudsters’ threatening language, in which repetition and interruption are counted in clauses and suprasegmental skills in syllables. Statistically, 335 threat clauses in the 20 clips consist of 41 repetitions (accounting for 12.2% of all) and 32 times of interruption (9.6%), in which repetitions are often used by fraudsters to emphasize their preys’ troubles while interruption always for stopping victims’ doubts. Data analysis shows that no conversational skill does not work more effectively together with other ones. In order to exert more and more pressure over victims, fraudsters use repetition or interruption skills with suprasegmental ones like loudness or higher pitches for stress (see Extract 2). As for suprasegmental skills, higher pitches amount to 1065, taking up 26.9% of all the 3948 syllables; increasing intensities to 1333, accounting for 33.8%. Data analysis has found that higher pitch and increasing intensity have always been carried in same syllables, which shows that fraudsters try to reinforce the threat of those Chinese words (also see Extract 2).Table 2Fraudsters’ conversational skillsConversational skillsClausesSyllablesFrequency%Frequency%Repetition4112.2Interruption329.6Higher pitch106526.9Increasing intensity133333.8Total 3353948Open in a separate windowAt the macro-level, fraudsters’ threatening utterances collaboratively promote discourse development according to the prepared scripts in that language use exists in contexts but beyond materials in the discourse [2]. Smooth development of fraud discourse is embodied through fraudsters’ prepared turn-taking system. Cellphone fraudsters do not work independently but in fraud groups, and their cellphone speeches are not uttered casually or spontaneously but in accordance with fraud scripts. In the threatening fraud interactions, fraudsters transmit prepared information through prepared turns to promote the discourse development as what they want. Prepared turns usually include such sharing information with victims as victims’ names, identity card numbers, addresses and so on, and some new information like victims’ guilt involved in criminal cases [50]. It is the combination information gaps and information sharing that help fraudsters bring victims’ thoughts and discourse into fraudulent discourse development.Situation-Based Implications for Preventing Cellphone fraudsCellphone fraudsters’ fictive actions bring victims into psychological vulnerability with power manipulation and position control in specific situations. DP examines “how and when identities shift discursively in face-to-face or online interaction” ([46]: 63). In accordance with the data analyzed above and the legal opinions or legal education from the police and mainstream media, two points should be noted for preventing cellphone frauds.On the one hand, fraudsters always predesign several steps based on the specific fraud interaction, and employ discursive strategies to make victims’ psychological change more deeply and bring victims into prepared sequence organizations. For example, people should pay much more attention to the five steps of cellphone frauds, in which fraudsters impersonate gang members. In Case 08, the fraudster gradually intensifies the victim’s panic in four steps so that he has successfully controlled the victim with his discursive power. It is the first step that the fraudster informs the victim that he is being tracked through sharing the victim’s personal information purchased online. The second step for the fraudster is to fabricate a story to initiate the threat to the victim in that the fraudster tells the victim that he has offended someone and the person who has paid the so-called gangdom for revenge on the victim. For the next step, the fraudster’s utterances perform the function to verify whether the victim has entered the play and whether the victim hopes to pay for the elimination of the disaster. In the fourth step, the fraudster reinforces the threat to further intimidate the victim in that the fraudster makes up a nickname that sounds tough enough and releases such cruel words as “刀尖上舔血 (licking blood on the tip of the knife)” and “白刀子进红刀子出 (white knife in, red knife out)”. After the fraudster’s four-step escalation of verbal violence, if the victim has been found in the tone of fear, the fraudster will carry out the fifth step to ask for money.On the other hand, it is the most important for people to improve information security awareness and enhance the ability to prevent frauds. It is suggested that the following reminders be remembered. Firstly, Bank card password or verification code is the last line of defense for capital security. Secondly, the public security authorities have never handled cases on the phone or video, have no so-called “safe account” and have never asked people to transfer money to it. Thirdly, the public security authorities have not realized direct communication with any other institution, department or company. Fourthly, it is a fraudulent action that someone frames your illegal sales of epidemic supplies. Fifthly, if there is an unfamiliar call asking for bills, dial the service hotline directly. Sixthly, if there is a threat from so-called gang members, call the police immediately. ConclusionThe present study describes fraudsters’ false identity construction in the threatening fraud interactions, examines fraudsters’ conversational skills and discursive strategies for their fraud purposes. The findings include: (1) fraudsters’ predetermined false identities are constructed and invoked through information gap and information sharing in the threatening fraud interactions; (2) in the false identity construction process, different conversational skills are used by fraudsters to threaten and entrap victims; (3) fraudsters’ discursive practices are situated for the threatening actions based on prepared and designed scripts.The present study not only conduces to the deep understanding of cellphone fraudsters’ threatening language in the fraud interactions, but provides a discursive psychological pathway to explore cellphone fraud at both macro-level and micro-level. The findings of the study are expected to provide references for the people’s fight against fraudsters’ threats and bullies, and for the people’s prevention of cellphone frauds. However, the study only focuses on the analysis of online audio or video data. As matter of a fact, it is necessary to carry out the interviews with fraudsters and victims for validity and reliability. In the future, with the help of public security authorities, face-to-face interviews with fraudsters and victims will be made for the in-depth empirical studies to support discursive psychological findings.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/30889175/,"AbstractIn In this study, the effects of different irrigation treatments (I100, I50, I30) on the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis hübner) populations in different corn genotypes (Ada-9510, Samada-07, Ada-523, Kompozit Arifiye) were investigated. As the average, the highest yield (1582.33 kg da-1), low number of live larva + pupa per plant (2.70), tunnel length (7.73 cm) were observed in I100 x ADA-523 interaction while the lowest yield (896.00 kg da-1) was observed in I30 x Kompozit Arifiye interaction. The largest European corn borer population was observed in full irrigation (I100) and the lowest population was observed in excessive water deficit (I30) treatment. The European corn borer preferred the Kompozit Arifiye genotype. It was concluded that the genotypes should be tested under water-stressed and non-water-stressed conditions for resistance to the European corn borer and live larva and tunnel length could be used as a screening parameter. IntroductionIn the world, there are several pests with negative impacts on corn culture in Turkey such as European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis hübner) and Mediterranean corn borer (Sesamia nonagrioides lefebvre) which are among all the most important ones. While the European corn borer is widespread in Europe, America and Turkey, the Mediterranean corn borer is widespread in in Mediterranean countries such as Spain, France, Italy, Greece and Turkey which is why it is called “Mediterranean Corn borer” in literature [1–3]. In the Çukurova district of Turkey, the European corn borer reproduces 3 to 4 times and the Mediterranean corn borer reproduces 4 to 5 times a year [4]. It has been reported in previous studies that the Mediterranean corn borer represented 38.95% of the corn pests in Çukurova while the European corn borer constituted 61.15%. It was indicated that these ratios were 70% for Mediterranean corn borer and 30% for European corn borer based on infected number of plants and were 87% for Mediterranean corn borer and 13% for European corn borer based on live larva + pupa ratio per plant [5]. The Mediterranean corn borer and the European corn borer create damages in all the organs of the corn plants, except for the roots. During the harvest, approximately 95% infections were observed in untreated fields [6] and approximately 30% yield loss was experienced [7]. Researchers reported that the Mediterranean corn borer resulted in between 0 and 10% yield losses in the first crop and 80 and 100% yield losses in the second crop of corn. [8].A study was carried out in Nebraska with irrigated and non-irrigated corn plots in which the European corn borer population was reported to be larger in irrigated plots than in non-irrigated plots [9]. In another study, the effects of different irrigation treatments (I100, I80, I60, I40, I20, I0) on the Mediterranean corn borer and the European corn borer populations were investigated and a larger population (27.167 per plant) of both species was reported in full irrigation treatments (I100) than in non-irrigated treatments (I0) (13.50 per plant) [10;11].Stressors stimulate the formation of reactive oxygen species in plants. These reactive species are usually called radicals and attack various surfaces in plant tissues and create damages. Free radicals mostly attack polyunsaturated fatty acids in cell membranes. The interaction of unsaturated fatty acids with these radicals alters the saturated and unsaturated fatty acid ratios of cell membranes [12]. Researchers reported increased total saturated fatty acid ratios with abiotic stressors [13].Eicosapolyenoic acids (EP), which do not occur in taller plants, including an oxidative burst and the transcriptional activation of genes involved in phytoalexin synthesis, lignification, programmed cell death, and other responses typically associated with the hypersensitive response (HR) to pathogens [14]. Previous studies have reported that common fatty acids in plant pathogenic oomycetes, and signals for immune responses and central nervous system development in mammals function as conserved signaling molecules across eukaryotic kingdoms. The fatty acids released during the infection of plants may serve as novel pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that engage plant signaling networks to induce resistance to pathogens [13]. The levels of free fatty acids increase in response to various stresses and play a pivotal role in plant–microbe interactions. For example, fatty acid synthesis in the obligate biotrophism of arbuscular-mycorrhizal fungi is dependent on plant-derived C16 FAs [15]. Furthermore, eggplants with enhanced levels of palmitoleic acid (16:1) exhibited increased resistance to Verticillium dahliae, suggesting an increase in the production of plant 16:1 as a viable approach to enhance crop resistance to fungal diseases [16].Several studies were performed to determine the quantitative sections in corn plants which developed resistance to the European corn borer [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. However, there are no studies in the literature regarding the effects of different irrigation levels (I100, I50, I30) on the European corn borer population in corn plants. Therefore, sufficient literature about the present research topic could not be provided.This study was conducted to investigate the effects of different irrigation levels (I100, I50, I30) on tunnel length and European corn borer population in different corn genotypes (Ada-9510, Samada-07, Ada-523, Kompozit Arifiye). Material and methodsExperiments were carried out on the experimental fields located in the province of Nevşehir, Turkey during the maize growing seasons of 2015. The research site has an altitude of 1045 m and is located on 38° 44' 17.52"" N and 34° 46' 20.00'' E. (Fig 1)Open in a separate windowFig 1Location of the study area.In this study, The Ada-9510, Samada-07, Ada-523, Kompozit Arifiye corn genotypes were used as the plant material. The long-term and annual climate data of the research site are provided in Table 1.Table 1Some climate datas of the study areas (2015 year).Months 2015Min. Temp.(°C)Max. Temp.(°C)Aver.

Precipitation is 41.6 mm in June, 8.4 mm in July. The average temperature is 0.8°C in winter, 10°C in spring, 20.9°C in summer and 11.7°C in autumn.Soil samples were taken before the sowing process from 0–90 cm soil profile (from three depth segments as 0–30, 30–60 and 60–90 cm). Soil moisture content at field capacity (33 kPa), bulk density, organic matter, texture and permanent wilting point analyses, water holding capacity at permanent wilting point were determined [24, 25]. The soil physico-chemical characteristics are provided in Table 2.Table 2Some soil physical and chemical soil characteristics of the research site.SoilDepth(cm)Sand(%)Clay(%)Silt(%)Organic material(%)TextureClassBulkDensity (g/cm3)FieldCapacity(%)WiltingPoint(%)0–303422441.04L1.4720.998.3830–603428380.46CL1.5821.559.3760–903224440.21L1.4822.7410.01Open in a separate windowC: Clay, CL: Clay Loam, L: LoamThe experimental soil had low electrical conductivity and salinity, low phosphor content, high potassium content and medium organic matter content. Lime levels did not cause any problems for plant growth. In Nevşehir, the field capacity was 22.74%, permanent wilting point was 10.01% and soil bulk density was 1.48 gr cm-3. Irrigation water quality parameters were determined in accordance with the method specified [26]. Irrigation water quality class was C4S2 with an average EC value of 0.27 dS m-1 and a pH value of 7.53 (Table 3).Table 3The quality characteristics of Irrigation water in study areas.pHEC (μs/cm)Ca (me/L)Mg(me/L)Na (me/L)K (me/L)CO3 (me/L)HCO3 (me/L)Cl (me/L)SO4(me/L)SARClass7.4927198.93.015.50.230.0014.623.229.566.43C4S2Open in a separate windowExperiments were conducted using randomized blocks-split plots experimental design with 3 replications with genotypes (Ada-9510, Samada-07, Ada-523, Kompozit Arifiye) on main plots and irrigation treatments (I100, I50 and I30) on sub-plots (Fig 2).Open in a separate windowFig 2Experimental design of the study area.The irrigation program was scheduled so that irrigation was performed once a week. Treatments were selected as full irrigation (I100) in which 100% of depleted moisture was supplied, water-stressed (WS) treatment (I50) in which 50% of depleted moisture was supplied and excessive water stress treatment (I30) in which 30% of depleted water was supplied. Therefore, one full irrigation treatment and two deficit irrigation treatments were created.Drip irrigation was used to perform the irrigations. A lateral line (20 mm and 4 atm operational pressure, 0.33 m apart 4 L h-1 drippers) was placed along each plant row. Soil infiltration rate was measured as 8 mm h-1. Deep percolation and surface runoff were not considered. Each plot had a size of 5.2 x 17 m (88.4 m2) consisting of 4 plant rows with 70 cm row spacing and 25 cm on-row plant spacing. A buffer zone of 2 m was placed between the experimental plots to prevent interactions.All of the phosphorus fertilizer (pure 90 kg da-1 P2O5) and one third of nitrogen (28 kg da-1 N) were supplied during the sowing process. The rest of the nitrogen was given when the plants were 40–50 cm tall.The gravimetric moisture content of each layer (0–30, 30–60 and 60–90 cm.) was converted into depth using Eq 1. d=(Pw-PwAW)x As x D/100(1) Where; d is soil moisture content in depth (mm), Pw is field capacity (%), PwAW is the moisture content of each layer (%), As is soil unit weight (g cm-3) and D is layer depth (mm). The volume of the water to be applied was calculated by using Eq 2. dT 0-90=d(0-30)+ d(30-60)+ d(60-90)(2) Where; dT 0–90 is soil moisture at 0–90 cm soil profile (mm), d (0–30) is soil moisture at 0–30 cm soil profile (mm), d (30–60) is soil moisture at 30–60 cm soil profile (mm) and d (60–90) is soil moisture at 60–90 cm soil profile (mm).The volume of the water to be applied to each plot was calculated by Eq 3. V=dTx A x Uox P(3) Where; V is the volume of water to be applied (L), A is plot size (m2), Uo is deficit ratio (%) and P is cover ratio (%).The plant canopy width was divided by row spacing to obtain cover ratios (CR). The ratio was taken as 0.30 and 0.80 for the cover ratios of 30% and 80%, respectively. The principles specified by researchers were used to find the amount of water to be used in each plot [27].Plant water consumptions were calculated by using Eq 4 [28]. ETa=P+I–Rf–Dp±ΔS(4) Where; ETa is evapotranspiration (mm), P is precipitation (mm), I is the amount of irrigation water (mm), Rf is surface flow (mm), Dp is deep percolation (mm) and ΔS is the change in soil moisture (mm).Harvest was performed when the seed moisture content decreased to 15% to determine the yields. Side rows and 0.5 m space at the top and bottom of the inner two rows were omitted to consider any side effects.Number of Live Larva + Pupa: In order to determine the effects of different irrigation levels on the number of live larva + pupa; 25 plants were split from the mid-sections into two halves and then the live larva and pupas were counted [5].Number of Live Larva + Pupa per plant: The total number of larva and pupa was divided by the number of plants to obtain the number of live larva + pupa per plant. The genotypes were then compared with each other based on these numbers.Number of holes / 100 internodes: To determine the effects of different irrigation levels on the number of holes / 100 internodes ratio, 25 plants from two rows of each genotype were harvested 20 days before the harvest. Leaves were removed from the plants. Then, the number of internodes and number of pest exit holes above and below the corn cobs were counted separately [29, 30].Number of holes / 100 internodes method:Below-cob section: Number of holes / 100 internodes = B / A x 100(Below-cob total number of holes was divided by below-cob total number of internodes and multiplied by 100). B: Below-cob total number of holes, A: Below-cob total number of internodes.Above-cob section: Number of holes / 100 internodes = E / D x 100(Above-cob total number of holes was divided by above-cob total number of internodes and multiplied by 100). E: Above-cob total number of holes, D: Above-cob total number of internodes.Whole plant: Number of holes / 100 internodes = (B + E) / (A + D) x 100(Below and above-cob total number of holes was divided by below and above-cob total number of internodes and multiplied by 100).Tunnel (gallery) Length / Plant: To determine the effects of different irrigation levels on tunnel (gallery) length / plant; 25 plants on which number of holes was counted were vertically split into two halves and the lengths of tunnels above and below the cobs were measured with a ruler [29, 30].Tunnel length / Plant: The genotypes assessed for tunnel length / plant were then assessed for damage index. Plants with tunnel lengths of less than 3 cm were assessed as highly resistant, with tunnel lengths between 3–7 cm were assessed as resistant, with tunnel lengths between 7–10 cm were assessed as moderately resistant, with tunnel length over 10 cm were assessed as sensitive. The tunnels with a length of less than 2.5 cm were not assessed as tunnels. Such holes were considered as entrance-exit of the pests that did not feed from the plant [30].Each plot had a length of 5.2 m and had 4 rows. Row spacing was 70 cm and on-row plant spacing was 25 cm. Two rows were used for yield and various observations and the other two rows were used for European corn borer damage assessments. European corn borer inoculations were not performed and natural larva was considered in all calculations and assessments. Pesticides were not applied to control main pests (Ostrinia nubilalis hübner). In addition, the effects of different irrigation levels (I100, I50, I30) on the Mediterranean corn borer (Sesamia nonagrioides lefebvre) populations were not found to be assessable because of the small size of the pest population.Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed in accordance with randomized blocks–split plots experimental design. Significant treatments were then subjected to Least Significant Difference (LSD) multiple comparison tests. Correlation analyses was carried out to identify the relationships between the traits. The directions of the relationships (positive or negative) were determined. The analyses were carried out with JUMP 5.0.1a statistical software [31]. Results and discussionIrrigation treatments were initiated on 01 July 2015 when 50% of the available moisture in efficient root zone (0–90 cm) was depleted and the treatments were terminated on 11 September 2015. Harvest was performed on 30 September 2015 in the I30 and on 03 October 2015 in the I100 treatments (Table 4).Table 4Changes in yield and physiological properties of corn genotypes depending on the amount of irrigation water.TreatmentsYield(kg ha -1)**NOH/100(number plant-1)**TL/P(cm)**TNOAL+PP(number plant-1)**Irrigation water(mm)ETa(mm)**WUE(kg ha mm -1)**I100 (FI)1365.33 a11.61 a18.468 a5.75 a508.25553.00 a3.73 aI70 (DI)1309.58 b9.89 b18.465 a4.54 b310.75367.41 b3.58 bI30 (DI)1095.66 c7.48 c8.99 b3.38 c242.00293.25 c2.46 cLSD (0.05)2.000.0750.330.236.010.042ADA—5231430.00 a10.85 a9.79 d3.64 d510400.20 b3.72 aADA—95101387.00 b9.62 b12.63 c4.38 c508408.11 a3.58 bSAMADA—071252.00 c9.28 c17.12 b4.83 b509400.30 b3.26 cKompozit Arifiye959.00 d8.89 d21.67 a5.38 a506410.00 a2.47 dLSD (0.05)8.570.0950.150.206.99I100 x ADA-5231582.33 a13.70 a11.66 g4.54 de510547.66 a2.88 gI100 x ADA-95101481.66 b11.50 b15.06 e5.46 c508553.33 a2.67 hI100 x SAMADA-071394.00 c11.10 c18.26 d6.19 b509558.00 a2.49 ıI100 x Kompozit Arifiye1003.33 f10.16 e29.36 a6.82 a506553.00 a1.81 jI50 x ADA-5231496.33 b10.61 d10.48 h3.70 f300361.33 c4.14 bI50 x ADA-95101384.66 c9.72 f13.55 f4.37 e326376.66 b3.68 dI50 x SAMADA-071380.66 c9.62 f24.41 c4.70 d306349.66 c3.94 cI50 x Kompozit Arifiye976.66 g9.62 f25.41 b5.42 c311382.00 b2.56 hıI30 x ADA-5231211.00 e8.24 g7.73 k2.70 h243291.33 d4.15 bI30 X ADA-95101294.00 d7.65 h9.30 ı3.46 g246294.33 d4.39 aI30 X SAMADA-07981.66 g7.13 ı8.70 j3.60 fg240293.00 d3.35 eI30 x Kompozit Arifiye896.00 h6.88 j10.25 h3.89 f239291.33 d3.04 fLSD (0.05)14.850.160.270.3512.111.24Open in a separate window* and **, significant at P≤0.05 and P≤ 0.01 level, respectively; ns, not significant; means in the same column with similar letter are not significantly different from each other; NOH/100, Number of holes /100 internodes; TL/P, Tunnel length/plant; TNOAL+PP, The number of alive larva+pupa in the plant; ETa, Plant water consumptions; WUE, Water use efficiencyWith regard to kernel yield, main plot (genotype) x sub-plot (irrigation) interactions were found to be significant (P<0.01). The kernel yields of the first crop varied between 896–1582.33 kg ha-1 with the greatest yield from I100 x ADA-523 interaction (1582.33 kg ha-1) and the lowest yield from I30 x Kompozit Arifiye interaction (896 kg ha-1). While I100 x ADA—523 interaction was placed in Group A, I30 x Kompozit Arifiye interaction was placed in Group H. According to the variance analyses for the yields, the irrigation treatments and genotypes were also found to be significant (P<0.01). The greatest yield (1365.33 kg ha-1) was obtained from the I100 treatment and the lowest yield (1095.66 kg da-1) was obtained from the I30 treatment. In terms of the genotypes, the highest yield (1430 kg ha-1) was obtained in the ADA-523 genotype and the lowest yield (959 kg ha-1) was obtained in the Kompozit Arifiye genotype.Some researchers reported the yields of fully irrigated non-chemical treated plots to be between 10955.0–3690.0 kg ha-1 [5]. A different study reported the yields to be between 2650–10524.0 kg ha-1 [32]. In another study, the yields were reported to be between 3020.0–11020.0 kg ha-1 [33] and the yields of sensitive hybrids to be between 386.0–2683.0 kg ha-1 and the yields of resistant hybrids to be between 6803.0–9984.0 kg ha-1 [30].The findings of the present study are different from earlier studies due to differences in environmental factors, climate, irrigation programs, corn genotypes, cultural practices. With regard to the European corn borer population, main plot (genotype) x sub-plot (irrigation) interactions were found to be significant (P<0.01). European corn borer populations varied between 2.7–6.82 pests plant-1 with the largest population in the I100 x Kompozit Arifiye interaction (6.82 pest plant-1) and the lowest population in the I30 x ADA-523 interaction (2.7 pest plant-1). While the Kompozit Arifiye genotype was placed in Group A, the ADA-523 genotype was placed in Group H. According to the variance analyses on the European corn borer populations, irrigation treatments and genotypes were also found to be significant (P<0.01). The largest European corn borer population (5.75 number plant-1) was observed in the I100 treatment and the lowest population (3.38 number plant-1) was observed in the I30 treatment. In terms of the genotypes, the largest population (5.38 number plant-1) was observed in the Kompozit Arifiye genotype and the lowest population (3.64 number plant-1) was observed in the ADA-523 genotype.Some researchers reported the number of live larva + pupa in the 33P67 Bt (transgenic) genotype in the fully irrigated and untreated plots as 0.037 pest plant-1 and reported the value for isogenic (non-transgenic) 33P66 genotype as 2.220 pest plant-1. These values were partially similar to the values of the present study [5].With regard to tunnel lengths, main plot (genotype) x sub-plot (irrigation) interactions were found to be significant (P<0.01). Tunnel lengths varied between 29.36–7.73 cm with the greatest value in the I100 x Kompozit Arifiye interaction and the lowest value in the I30 x ADA-523 interaction. While the Kompozit Arifiye genotype was placed in Group A, the 31D24 genotype was placed in Group K. According to the variance analyses on tunnel lengths, irrigation treatments and genotypes were found to be significant. The greatest tunnel length (18.46 cm) was observed in the I100 treatment and the shortest tunnel length (8.99 cm) was observed in the I30 treatment. Considering the tunnel lengths of the genotypes, the greatest value (21.67 cm) was observed in the Kompozit Arifiye genotype and the lowest value (9.79 cm) was observed in the ADA-523 genotype.Researchers reported the tunnel lengths in fully irrigated untreated plots to be between 0.2–56.9 cm plant-1 [34]. These values were different from the values of the present study due to differences in environmental factors, climates, cultural practices, irrigation programs, genotypes, inoculations and biotic stress factors.With regard to the number of holes 100 internodes-1 values, main plot (genotype) x sub-plot (irrigation) interactions were found to be significant (P<0.01). The number of holes 100 internodes-1 values varied between 6.88–13.70 with the greatest value in the I100 x ADA-523 interaction (13.70) and the lowest value in the I30 x Kompozit Arifiye interaction (6.88). While the ADA-523 genotype was placed in Group A, the Kompozit Arifiye genotype was placed in Group J. According to the variance analyses, irrigation treatments and genotypes were also found to be significant (P<0.01). The greatest number of holes 100 internodes-1 value (11.61) was observed in the I100 treatment and the lowest value (7.48) was observed in the I30 treatment. In terms of the number of holes 100 internodes-1 values of the genotypes, the greatest value (10.85) was observed in the ADA-523 and the lowest value (8.89) was observed in the Kompozit Arifiye genotype.Researchers reported number of holes 100 internodes-1 value as 0.130 for 33P67 Bt (transgenic) genotype, 8.350 for 33P66 genotype and 8.768 for TTM 815 genotype [5]. Other researchers reported the least number of holes 100 internodes-1 value of fully irrigated untreated plots as 6.1 for the 9B x 24A genotype and the greatest as 80.1 for the 7C2 x 9A genotype [32]. Some researchers carried out a study on the effects of different irrigation treatments (I0, I20, I40, I60, I80, I100) on the European corn borer and Mediterranean corn borer in second crop corn under the conditions observed in Çukurova and reported number of holes 100 internodes-1 value of the ADA 9516 genotype as 13.50 in the I0 treatment and 27.167 in the I100 treatment [10, 34]. These findings are partially different from the findings of the present study due to differences in irrigation programs, corn genotypes, cultural practices, climate conditions and resistance of the genotypes to biotic stress.The greatest values in the number of live larva + pupa, number of holes 100 internodes-1, tunnel length were obtained from the I100 treatment and the lowest values were obtained in the I30 treatment. The European corn borer population also decreased in the I30 treatment compared to the I100 treatment. The European corn borer preferred fully irrigated plants.Correlations of the irrigations with yield, plant height, chlorophyll, plant water consumptions, water use efficiency were also investigated in this study and significant correlations were observed (p<0.01 and p<0.05) (Table 5).Table 5The correlation coefficients between irrigation (I100, I50, I30,) and other parameters.Yield(kg ha-1)Plant height(m)Chlorophyll (spad)ETa(mm)WUE(kg ha mm -1)Yield (kg da-1)Plant height (m)0,13nsKlorofil0,33ns0,43*ETa0,41*0,54*0,91**WUE0,28ns-0,48*-0,70**-0,74**Open in a separate window* and **, significant at P≤0.05 and P≤ 0.01 level, respectively; ns, not significant; NOH/100, Number of holes /100 internodes; TL/P, Tunnel length/plant; TNOAL+PP, The number of alive larva+pupa in the plant; ETa, Plant water consumptions; WUE, Water use efficiencyThe correlations coefficients (r) for the experimental year (2015) are provided in Table 5. Significant correlations were observed between some traits (p<0.01 and p<0.05). Highly significant correlations were observed between plant water consumptions and yield (r = 0.41*), plant water consumptions and plant height (r = 0.54**), plant water consumptions and chlorophyll (r = 0.91**), plant water consumptions and water use efficiency (r = -0.74**). ConclusionsThe present study was conducted to investigate the effects of different irrigation treatments on the European corn borer populations of four corn genotypes. This study also aimed to determine the biotic stress screening parameters in the identification of the genotypes that are resistant to biotic stress. For the determination of the screening parameters, yield, tunnel length, live larva + pupa at different irrigation treatments (I100, I50 and I30) were used. The European corn borer preferred the I100 treatment the most and the I30 treatment the least. However, the pest did not prefer each genotype at the same level even in the I100 treatment. The genotype sensitive to European corn borer (European corn borer) had higher fatty acid contents and types than the genotype resistant to the European corn borer (ADA-523). In this case, the sensitive genotypes synthesized higher quantities of fatty acids than the resistant genotypes under water deficit and biotic stress. It was also determined that the genotypes with the greatest number of holes had high yield levels and the genotypes with the greatest tunnel length, high number of live larva + pupa and fatty acid contents had low yield levels. Significant correlations were observed between all investigated traits (P < 0.01 / P < 0.05).In this study, increasing yield, number of holes 100 internodes-, tunnel length and live larva + pupa values were observed with increasing amount of irrigation water. Therefore, the genotypes with similar performance under both water-stressed and non-stressed conditions could be identified as resistant to the European corn borer. On the other hand, rather than the number of holes 100 internodes-1, tunnel length could yield more accurate outcomes in European corn borer resistance studies. In this study, the genotype ADA-523 with low tunnel lengths was identified as moderately resistant and the Kompozit Arifiye genotype with high tunnel lengths was identified as sensitive to biotic stress. Several stress screening parameters of the present study can be used in the identification of genotype resistances to biotic stressors. The present findings can further be proved with field experiments in future studies.

However, it can be difficult to understand speech when the talker is wearing a mask, especially for listeners with hearing loss (Chodosh et al., 2020; Tucci, 2020). By studying the acoustic effects of masks on speech signals, we can learn which masks are best for speech transmission and find ways to make communication easier.Most prior research on masked speech has focused on medical equipment such as surgical masks and N95 respirators. Recent acoustic studies have shown that surgical masks and N95 respirators can attenuate higher-frequency sounds by between 3 and 12 dB (Atcherson et al., 2020; Goldin et al., 2020; Wolfe et al., 2020). Listening tests using audio-only recordings made with medical masks have not shown significant effects on speech intelligibility (Mendel et al., 2008; Palmiero et al., 2016; Thomas et al., 2011).To conserve supplies of medical masks, health authorities have recommended cloth masks, which can be made from household materials or purchased commercially. Recent studies suggest that the efficacy of cloth masks at blocking respiratory droplets depends on the fabric material, weave, and number of layers. Konda et al. (2020) found filtration efficiency to be higher for densely woven cotton and hybrid fabrics than for loosely woven cotton. Masks with more layers were more efficient. Aydin et al. (2020) found that single-layer masks made of t-shirt fabric were among the most porous materials studied, but three-layer masks performed as well as medical masks. They also found an inverse relationship between breathability and droplet-blocking efficiency.Because both medical and cloth face masks obstruct visual cues that contribute to speech intelligibility (Llamas et al., 2008), there has been growing interest in transparent face coverings such as plastic shields and face masks with windows (Atcherson et al., 2020; Wolfe et al., 2020). In listening tests with audiovisual recordings of talkers, transparent masks improved intelligibility for listeners with severe-to-profound hearing loss compared to opaque paper masks (Atcherson et al., 2017).To understand the effects of masks on speech, we measured the acoustic attenuation of a surgical mask, N95 and KN95 respirators, six cloth masks made from different fabrics, two cloth masks with transparent windows, and a plastic shield, as shown in Fig. ​Fig.1.1. The measurements used both a head-shaped loudspeaker and a live human talker. The experiments show that different masks have different high-frequency effects and that they alter the directivity of speech. Finally, to examine the effects of masks on sound reinforcement and assistive listening systems, we tested microphones placed on the lapel, cheek, forehead, and next to the mouth. These amplification technologies may prove critical to verbal communication during the pandemic.Open in a separate windowFIG. 1.(Color online) Masks used in experiments and described in Table ​TableII. II. METHODSTo simulate sound heard by a conversation partner, a side-address cardioid condenser microphone (Rode NT1-A) was placed two meters from the talker position. To study the effect of masks on sound reinforcement and assistive listening systems, omnidirectional lavalier condenser microphones (Countryman B3) were placed next to the mouth (“headset” position), on the lapel, on the cheek, and the forehead of the talker, as shown in Fig. ​Fig.2.2. All microphones have flat frequency responses from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. The laboratory walls are acoustically treated with 8-in. melamine and 2-in. polyurethane foam wedges.Open in a separate windowFIG. 2.(Color online) Speech signals were produced by a human talker and loudspeaker model. Microphones were placed at listener distance and at several points on and near the face.Sound was produced by two sources. A custom-built head-shaped loudspeaker produced ten-second logarithmic frequency sweeps to measure acoustic transfer functions between the talker and listener positions. The plywood loudspeaker uses a 2-in. full-range driver (Tectonic TEBM35C10-4) and has a directivity pattern that is closer to that of a human talker compared to studio monitors. It has a nominally flat on-axis frequency response over the tested range from 100 Hz to 16 kHz. To characterize the directional effects of masks, the loudspeaker was placed on a turntable and rotated in 15 degree increments while the “listener” microphone remained fixed.For more realistic speech signals, 30-s read-speech recordings were made from a human talker, who attempted to use a consistent speech level for each recording. Recordings of the human talker were repeated three times non-consecutively with each mask. Human subject research was approved by the University of Illinois Institutional Review Board.For both the loudspeaker and human experiments, measurements were first taken with no face covering to establish a baseline. The recordings were then repeated with the 12 face coverings listed in Table ​TableII and shown in Fig. ​Fig.11.TABLE I.Mask measurements and 2–16 kHz acoustic attenuation results (mean ± standard deviation).MaterialLayersThickness (mm)Mass (g)Speaker atten. at listener (dB)Human atten. at listener (dB)Human atten. at lapel (dB)1Polypropylene (YY/T 0969)30.433.62.8 ± 1.31.0 ± 1.42KN95 respirator (GB 2626)20.644.02.6 ± 1.10.0 ± 1.33N95 respirator (3 M 8210)11.595.75.4 ± 1.23.6 ± 1.34Cotton jersey (generic)20.7114.03.1 ± 1.10.5 ± 1.15Cotton plain (handmade)20.5114.04.3 ± 1.11.4 ± 1.26Cotton/spandex jersey (generic)31.5166.15.2 ± 1.52.3 ± 1.37Cotton/spandex jersey (LASC)20.9178.26.1 ± 1.22.0 ± 1.18Cotton plain and denim (Jo-Ann)21.1219.410.0 ± 1.33.2 ± 1.19Cotton percale bedsheet and polyester trim (handmade)21.01412.69.5 ± 1.73.1 ± 1.310Cloth and vinyl window (handmade)10.41210.87.8 ± 1.2--2.0 ± 1.511Cloth and PVC window (UTSDesignStore)10.3712.58.0 ± 1.70.4 ± 1.612Plastic shield (generic)10.45013.78.2 ± 1.2--7.6 ± 1.3Open in a separate window III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA. Acoustic attenuation of face coveringsFigure ​Figure33 shows the effects of several masks measured at the listener position. The plots on the left show the differences in acoustic transfer functions measured with and without masks on the loudspeaker model. The plots on the right show the corresponding results for the human talker averaged over three non-consecutive recordings; the human spectra varied by 1–2 dB between recordings, with larger variation at higher frequencies. The attenuation values shown in Table ​TableII are logarithmically weighted averages from 2 to 16 kHz, that is, means of the points shown in the plots.Open in a separate windowFIG. 3.(Color online) Effect of different masks on sound levels measured at the listener position for a head-shaped loudspeaker (left) and human talker (right). Human speech attenuation values are means over three recordings. The overall standard deviation between human recordings was between about 1 and 2 dB at the plotted frequencies.Most masks had little effect below 1 kHz but they attenuated higher frequencies by different amounts. The surgical mask (1) and KN95 respirator (2) had peak attenuation of around 4 dB, which is consistent with the results reported by Goldin et al. (2020) with a head-and-torso simulator. The N95 respirator (3) attenuated high frequencies by about 6 dB, which is similar to the average attenuation reported by Goldin et al. (2020).The cloth masks varied widely depending on material and weave. The 100% cotton masks in jersey (4) and plain (5) weaves had the best acoustic performance and were comparable to the surgical mask. The cotton/spandex blends performed worse. Surprisingly, the 2-layer cotton/spandex mask (7) produced greater attenuation than the 3-layer cotton/spandex mask (6), perhaps because it has a higher proportion of spandex and fit more snugly on the face. Masks made from tightly woven denim (8) and bedsheets (9) performed worst acoustically. It appears that material and weave are the most important variables for acoustic performance: More breathable fabrics transmit more sound.Finally, the transparent masks (10–12) performed poorly acoustically at high frequencies, blocking around 8 dB for the human talker and 10–14 dB for the loudspeaker. Although these masks are often recommended to help listeners with hearing loss because they preserve visual cues, they also harm the high-frequency sound cues that are crucial for speech.B. Effect of face coverings on speech directivityFigure ​Figure44 shows the relative high-frequency sound level as a function of angle for the head-shaped loudspeaker. The plot shows a logarithmically weighted average of relative sound level from 2 to 16 kHz. For all masks tested, acoustic attenuation was strongest in the front. Sound transmission to the side of and behind the talker was less strongly affected by the masks, and the shield (12) amplified sound behind the talker. These results suggest that masks may deflect sound energy to the sides rather than absorb it. Therefore, it may be possible to use microphones placed to the side of the mask for sound reinforcement.Open in a separate windowFIG. 4.(Color online) Spatial distribution of 2–16 kHz sound energy for a head-shaped loudspeaker with different masks in dB relative to no mask at 0 degrees.C. Effect of microphone placementMasks attenuate high-frequency sound for distant listeners, but they have different effects on microphones on and near the face. Figure ​Figure55 shows the acoustic effects of the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) window mask (11) on different microphones on a human talker. The listener and headset microphones experience similar high-frequency attenuation. The cheek microphone taped under the mask recorded higher sound levels, but with spectral distortion. The lapel and forehead microphones showed small and mostly uniform attenuation over the range of speech frequencies. Similar results were obtained for masks 1–10, although the performance of the cheek microphone varied depending on the shape of the mask. The shield (12) strongly distorted speech spectra for all microphones.Open in a separate windowFIG. 5.(Color online) Effect of the PVC window mask (11) on sound levels measured at different microphones relative to the same measurements with no mask on a human talker.Figure ​Figure66 compares several masks using a lapel microphone. Only the shield has a strong effect on the speech spectrum at the lapel. Sound capture and reinforcement systems used in classrooms and lecture halls often rely on lapel microphones, and remote microphones that transmit to hearing aids are often worn near the chest. These systems should work with masks with little modification. A recent audio-only listening experiment with normal-hearing adults showed that remote microphones can improve intelligibility with some transparent masks (Rudge et al., 2020).Open in a separate windowFIG. 6.(Color online) Effect of several masks on sound levels at a lapel microphone on a human talker relative to sound levels at the same microphone with no mask. IV. CONCLUSIONSThese experiments show that face masks attenuate high-frequency sound in front of the talker, with the strongest attenuation above 4 kHz. Surgical masks offer the best acoustic performance among all masks tested. If those masks are not available, loosely woven 100% cotton masks perform well acoustically, although they may offer less protection against small droplets than medical masks. Tightly woven cotton and blended fabrics are less porous but also transmit less sound. Multilayer masks made of loosely woven cotton may offer a reasonable compromise between droplet-blocking efficiency and acoustic performance.Shields and masks with windows perform much worse acoustically than opaque cloth masks. Fortunately, window masks do not strongly affect the lapel microphones used in sound reinforcement and assistive listening systems. To preserve visual cues without destroying high-frequency sound cues, talkers can wear clear window masks and lapel microphones. Although face masks make verbal communication more difficult, amplification technologies can help people with and without hearing loss to hear each other during the pandemic.",i  introductiona world

IntroductionRail transit has become a widely utilized means of transportation [1,2] owing to its large capacity, high speed, low energy consumption, and other outstanding characteristics. Since the Medium- and Long-Term Railway Network Plan was proposed in 2004, China has made remarkable achievements in high-speed rail development. So far, high speed railway operation mileage has exceeded 20,000 km, which accounts for more than 60% of global operation mileage. China has become the country with the fastest development of high speed railway in the world, with the strongest integration capacity, longest operation mileage, fastest operation speed and the largest scale of construction [3,4]. The rapid development of high-speed trains cannot depart from the support of high performance sensor technology. As a type of detector, sensors can feel measured information and convert it into electrical signals according to certain rules; this plays an indispensable role in ensuring the performance, safety, and intelligence of rail transit train systems. In terms of the high performance control of the traction drive system, the advanced Alternating Current (AC) drive control technology, such as the direct torque control and vector control of the traction motor, is inseparable from the sensor for testing the states of traction motors and inverters [5,6,7]; in terms of the safety of the train operation, the sensors play an important role in detecting the system state; in terms of intelligence of the rail transit, how to grasp more data for train operation to support the intelligent control of the train. Intelligent monitoring and diagnosis, intelligent maintenance, and other relevant functions are also inseparable from the advanced sensors for monitoring and controlling the train [8,9]. The CRH380AL for example, is equipped with more than 1000 sensors [10]. The current study takes the train traction system sensor as an example. A traction system mainly consists of a transformer, AC/direct current (DC) rectifier, inverter, and traction motor. In this paper, we follow the sequence of the sensor signal flow, consequently present the sensor signal sensing technology, and the sensor data acquisition and processing technology, as well as the sensor fault diagnosis technology, based on voltage, current, speed and temperature sensors which are commonly used in the train traction system in Section 2, Section 3, and Section 4 respectively. In Section 5, we have analyzed the characteristics and key technology of the intelligent sensors. Future research hotspots and challenges for the railway transit sensor are discussed in Section 6. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 7. 2. Signal Sensing Technologies of Traction System Sensors Some important information that the train traction system needs to collect is shown in Figure 1, including grid voltage and current, traction motor current and temperature, power module temperature and motor speed, and other speed-related signals [11,12,13]. Thus, a variety of sensors are needed for sensing different signals, these commonly used sensors can be divided into four categories: current sensor, voltage sensor, speed sensor and temperature sensor. The most widely used signal sensing technologies of traction system sensors are introduced below.Open in a separate windowFigure 1Traction system collected information.2.1. Signal Sensing Principle of Current and Voltage SensorsAs the most important electrical signals of traction systems, voltage and current signals serve as the basis to control the four-quadrant rectifier and traction inverter. Power electronic devices are extensively used on trains, and the measurement of the voltage and current satisfies such requirements as good dynamic performance, wide working bandwidth, and availability to measure any waveform. Hall sensors [14] can meet such requirements and are widely used on trains. The design of Hall current sensors are based on the Hall-effect, and the principle of this effect is presented as follows. As shown in Figure 2a, suppose the thickness and through current is D and I respectively for the Hall semiconductor, and suppose that a magnetic field exists whose magnetic flux density is B, located perpendicular to the surface of the Hall element; the magnetic field will generate a Hall electric potential perpendicular to the directions of the current and magnetic field. The scale of this potential is:UH=RHIBD(1) where RH is the Hall coefficient of the Hall sensor. When the current through the Hall device is fixed, the Hall voltage UH is directly proportional to the magnetic field B. The Hall device can be employed to detect the magnetic field B induced by the measured current if UH is measured, then the current can be obtained according to the Ampere Circuital Theorem.Open in a separate windowFigure 2(a) Schematic diagram of the Hall-effect; (b) Schematic diagram of direct measurement by the Hall current sensor; (c) Schematic diagram of the zero-flux Hall current sensor.The actual Hall current sensors have two types of structures: direct measurement sensors (Figure 2b) and zero-flux sensors (Figure 2c) [15]. The direct measurement sensors have the advantage of consisting of a simple structure. However, the magnetic core may become saturated, and result in an eddy-current with hysteresis losses existing in the magnetic core. The zero-flux sensors can amplify the output voltage of the Hall device, output a compensation current Is through the compensation coil N2, and counteract the magnetic field generated from the measured current, so the magnetic flux density is basically zero in the magnetic core, and will not make the magnetic core become saturated or produce significant hysteresis and eddy-current loss. The relationship between the balanced output current and the primary coil current is:Io=N2N1Is(2)The Hall voltage sensor is similar to the current sensor in working principle，but only converts voltage into current.2.2. Signal Sensing Principle for Speed SensorsSpeed sensors are adopted to detect the traction motor speed. The speed sensors which are widely used on traction systems mainly include Hall speed sensors and photoelectric speed sensors.Hall speed sensors also utilize the Hall-effect, and its working principle is illustrated in Figure 3a. Hall speed sensors are usually used together with wheel gears, whose rotation can have the magnetic reluctance changing periodically along with the air gap. The Hall device outputs tiny pulse signals, and the rotation speed can be determined by means of processed pulse signals [16]. Hall speed sensors are widely used on trains by virtue of the output signals of square waves featuring high sensitivity, large output amplitude, small temperature drift, and other outstanding advantages.Open in a separate windowFigure 3(a) Schematic diagram for the working principle of Hall speed sensors; (b) Schematic diagram for the principle of photoelectric speed sensors.The working principle of the photoelectric speed sensor is the photoelectric effect [17], as shown in Figure 3b. Photoelectric speed sensors change light signals into electrical impulses through optical grating, and finally convert this into the motor speed. Photoelectric speed sensors can output square wave signals with high precision, high resolution, and high reliability. However, the photoelectric components easily age. Thus, in the interests of safety, the photoelectric module must be replaced after the photoelectric sensor has been in operation for 300,000 km, or five years.2.3. Signal Sensing Principle of Temperature SensorsThe temperature sensors applied in the traction system mainly include platinum resistance temperature sensors and negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor temperature sensors.The platinum resistance temperature sensor resistance changes with the temperature, and the function expression for PT100 is [18]:RT={R0(1+AT+BT2+C(T−100)T3−200°C≤T≤0°CR0(1+AT+BT2)0°C≤T≤600°C(3) where RT and R0 indicate the platinum resistance values at the temperature T and 0 °C, respectively; A, B, and C are constants. Equation 3 shows that the real-time temperature value can be obtained by the resistance. Three-wire or four-wire systems are generally adopted during actual operation to eliminate the influence of lead resistance. The platinum resistance temperature sensors are often utilized in harsh and high precision-demanding conditions, such as for the internal temperature measurement of the traction motor.The thermistor temperature sensors are made according to the nature of the semiconductor material resistivity changing with temperature. The resistance value of a commonly employed NTC thermistor decreases with temperature increase, and the relationship in a certain temperature range is expressed as follows [19]:RT=R0eB(1T−1T0)(4) where B indicates the thermistor material constant related to the NTC thermistor materials. The NTC thermistor is often utilized to measure the temperature of the cooling system in the rail transit train.2.4. Application Prospect of the New Signal Sensing TechnologyThe train operates in an increasingly complex electromagnetic environment with developments focusing on extraordinarily heavy loads and high speed. Traditional electric sensors face these increasingly large difficulties in meeting the demands of electromagnetic interference and insulation. The fiber optic sensor is expected to be applied for rail transit systems due to its electromagnetic interference immunization, high-level voltage insulation, excellent security, and other outstanding advantages [20,21]. The fiber optic sensor is a sensor that uses optical fibers as its sensing material, and the parameters of the light waves can change with the measured signals. Relevant research has been conducted in recent years on sensing signals, such as current, voltage, speed, and temperature measurements by means of optical fibers.In terms of current sensing, the fiber optical current sensor has become the most potential optionm and has already been applied in power systems [22].In terms of voltage sensing, the fiber optical voltage sensor uses a non-metallic electro-optic crystal as its sensing element, with working principles based on the Pockels or Kerr effect. The piezoelectric crystal and fiber Bragg grating have been adopted to develop a 13.8 kV voltage sensor with a precision of up to 0.2% [23].In terms of fiber optic velocity measurements, ordinary photoelectric speed sensors would experience train speed jumping during braking or starting, due to electromagnetic interference [24]. Replacing the photoelectric encoders with fiber optical encoders can solve this issue.In terms of fiber optic temperature measurements, the platinum resistor temperature sensor has the disadvantage of insufficient insulation. If fluorescence fiber optic temperature sensors [25] with no metal components are used, then the aforementioned problem can be satisfactorily solved. 3. Sensor Data Acquisition and Processing The signals obtained by means of signal sensing technology are diverse, apt to attenuation, and susceptible to interference [26], therefore, acquiring and processing the sensor output signal are also important problems that must be considered. Figure 4 shows that the speed sensor output signal can be acquired and processed via a simple interface circuit; however, processing the analog signal is relatively complicated, and the signal processing requires more steps, such as analog signal processing, analog-to-digital converter (ADC) data sampling, and digital filtering processing. The technology for analog signal processing, data sampling, and digital filtering are summarized in the following section.Open in a separate windowFigure 4Sensor signal acquisition and processing.3.1. Analog Signal ProcessingThe sensor analog output signals feature different categories (e.g., voltage, current, and impedance types), significant weakness, high output impedance, and vulnerability to interference. The processing of analog signals is commonly made up of parts, such as the current or frequency–voltage conversion, impedance matching, filter, and amplifying circuits, with the purpose to make the sensor output signals adaptive to ADC acquisition. As an important unit of signal processing, the analog filter can restrain noise and attenuate useless frequency signals. Notably, the inverter frequency in the traction system changes with the motor speed, whereas the grid voltage and four-quadrant rectifier input current are fixed at 50 Hz; besides, there are some possibilities with a frequency approximated to zero, such as the DC-link voltage, cooling water temperature, and motor temperature. This condition requires that the filters have different parameters for different data.Figure 5 shows a typical signal processing circuit of traction control unit temperature sensors. Both ends of PT100 are connected to a 4.9 mA constant current source through A1 and A2. The voltage follower obtains a differential input voltage Uin through B1 and B2, and generates a low output resistance voltage signal. The output signal enters into the filter circuit and the amplifier circuit for satisfying the ADC requirement.Open in a separate windowFigure 5Functional block diagram for temperature signal processing.3.2. Sensor Data Sampling TechnologyCollecting the data at discrete sampling times is necessary within digital control of the traction system. The sampling time of the analog signal must be considered. Shannon sampling theory [27] shows that in order to record all information contained in a ω-bandlimited continuous signal, it suffices to record samples of the signal’s amplitude at discrete points in time, namely at the so-called Nyquist rate of 2ω samples per second. When the switching frequency is comparatively high, it can be approximately assumed that the sampling frequency needs to be twice that of the switching frequency. However, time delays gradually become apparent and therefore present a significant effect on the performance of the control system in the case of a low switching frequency. Figure 6 shows that five rounds of data acquisition are completed in one switching cycle, thereby making the control and modulation sampling time independent.Open in a separate windowFigure 6Schematic diagram for sampling in a switching cycle.The effects of sampling time on inverter switching loss, harmonic loss, and torque ripple of a direct torque-controlled induction motor drive are investigated in [28]. A cost function that consists of motor harmonic losses, torque ripples, and inverter switching losses, are defined to determine the optimum value of sampling time. The sampling time is selected based on minimizing this cost function. Reference [29] studies the effect of sampling time, switching frequency, and quantization step on the position performance of a vector-controlled inverter, through experiments performed. In the digital control system, a single sampling method is somewhat limited under certain conditions, and researchers have paid much attention to multiple sampling theory. The digital control system that boasts multiple sampling rates can realize different control functions that the single-sampling-rate digital control system hardly attains, such as simultaneous stabilization, strong stabilization, and system robustness improvement [30,31]. A multi-rate model reference adaptive system (MRAS) is proposed in [32] to estimate the rotor time constant, and to obtain a highly stable and less noisy estimation result for the rotor time constant for the asynchronous motor. Experimental results has verified the effectiveness of this algorithm. The Kalman filtering algorithm is combined with multiple sampling in [33] to estimate the permanent magnet synchronous motors speed. A slow sampling frequency is adopted for the motor current, whereas a fast sampling frequency is adopted for the output voltage. Simulation and real-time experiments are conducted to verify that its algorithm is superior to that of the single-sampling-rate Kalman filtering algorithm, in terms of recognition accuracy and convergence stability. Multi-rate theory, which adopts different sampling frequencies in the speed loop, flux loop, and parameter estimation to lower the torque ripple in direct torque control systems of asynchronous motors, is also utilized in [34,35].3.3. Digital Filtering TechnologyThe digital signals converted from the ADC or digital interface still cannot be utilized directly. They may also require further processing, such as digital filtering. Digital filtering is widely applied in train traction systems, such as in the following: Digital filtering can be used as an effective supplement to hardware filtering, and can overcome the disadvantage of fixed hardware filtering frequency characteristics.Digital filtering can be employed to filter indirect measure signals. For example, motor torque signals are observed by flux linkage and current signals. The observed torque has significant high-frequency fluctuations, and cannot be utilized to the control loop before filtering.The digital filter is also used to extract particular signals. For example, the DC link voltage of the traction drive system has twice the power frequency pulsation. A notch filter is required to extract the ripple voltage. When the high-frequency voltage is injected to observe the location of the permanent magnet synchronous motor rotor, a band-pass or band-stop filter is also required to extract certain signals [36,37].Frequency response characteristics show that digital filters can be divided into four types: low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and band-stop filters. They also can be divided into finite impulse response (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR) filters [38], according to the length of the unit impulse response h(n).The unit impulse response h(n) of the FIR filter is a length-finite sequence, and the time-domain input and output relation can be expressed as follows:y(n)=∑i=0N−1h(i)x(n−i)(5) where N indicates the number of the FIR filter taps, h(i) indicates the tap coefficient at level I (unit pulse response), x(n − i) indicates the input signal after a delay of i taps, and y(n) indicates the output signal at the moment n. The time-domain input and output relation of the IIR filter can be expressed as follows:y(n)=∑r=0Mbrx(n−r)+∑k=1Naky(n−k)(6) where br and ak are constants. Equations (5) and (6) show that the FIR filter output is only related to the input, but not directly related to the previous output. Thus, its network structure contains no feedback branch. The IIR filter output consists of two parts. The first part is an input M-section delay chain structure with all delay taps weighted and added up, whereas the second part is the sum of the y(n) delay taps after being weighed, so it contains a feedback network. The transfer function of the IIR filter system can have its poles located anywhere within the unit circle, such that a low-order filter can offer higher frequency selectivity compared with the FIR filter, thus the IIR filter can achieve higher economy and efficiency than FIR [39]. Therefore, the IIR filters are more widely adopted in traction systems compared with the FIR filters. For example, the grid voltage, torque, and current filters are generally realized by the first- or second-order low-pass filters in the form of IIR. Reference [40] proposed a fault diagnosis method of DC-link circuit based on a notch filter in an electrical power traction converter. The notch filter is equivalent to a band stop filter and can be used to eliminate the selected frequency component without influencing the other frequency components of the system. The second order notch filter has a transfer function, which is expressed as follows:y=s2+ω22s2+2τω2s+ω22,(7) where ω2 indicates the notch frequency, and τ indicates the parameter related to the quality factor. It can be converted to the z-plane from s-plane using the impulse response invariant method, or the bilinear transformation method. For example, the bilinear transformation s=2fs1−z−11+z−1 and the transfer function of the notch can be easily converted to a digital wave trap, as shown in the following:y[k] = a0x[k] + a1x[k − 1] + a2x[k − 2]−b1y[k − 1]−b2y[k − 2], (8) where a0, a1, a2, b1, and b2 are constants. x[k] and y[k] indicate the input signal and filter response, respectively. 4. Sensor Fault DiagnosisThe sensor signals after acquisition and processing generally enter the train monitoring, control, and other relevant systems for monitoring, or a closed loop control. The reliability of the sensor signals must be ensured in these conditions. Any error signal fed into the train control system without processing can result in serious consequences; thus, diagnosing train sensor faults is necessary for safety and economy. Sensor fault diagnosis currently adopts hardware and analytical redundancy methods [41]. The hardware redundancy method employs multiple sensors to measure the same system parameter, thereby increasing system complexity and costs. The analytical redundancy method mainly provides redundancy information through analytical relations between different output values of the system. It can be divided into two methods, which are dependent on, or independent of models. In this section, only analytical redundancy methods are presented.4.1. Current Sensor Fault DiagnosisThe current sensor is the basis for controlling the traction inverter. The majority of existing fault diagnosis studies are based on the control model of asynchronous or permanent magnet synchronous motors. These methods generally design a particular observer and then determine whether the current sensor is faulty, by comparing the observed information with the measured information.The fault diagnosis method is different between asynchronous motors and permanent magnet synchronous motors, due to their different models. In terms of an asynchronous traction motor, a full-order adaptive observer is adopted in [42] to produce a residual error, and then to judge the current sensor fault according to the residual error and the given threshold value. The fault detect method can isolate the incipient fault of a speed sensor and current sensors in real-time, but the performance of the state observer is degraded at very low speed. In reference [43], three Luenberger observers are used to realize a fault diagnosis of the current sensors, as shown in Figure 7. The proposed three paralleled adaptive observers are capable of current sensor fault detection and localization. An adaptive current observer that can identify the rotor resistance is proposed in [44], with the estimated phase currents and rotor resistance being sent to a decision-making unit, which identifies the faulty sensor type based on a deterministic rule base. Unlike the other proposed model-based fault diagnosis systems using a bank of observers, with the proposed method, only one current observer with rotor-resistance estimation is sufficient for the isolation of all sensors faults. Open in a separate windowFigure 7Current sensor fault diagnosis method in [43].In terms of a permanent magnet synchronous motor, a current sensor fault diagnosis module for the harsh working conditions of the permanent magnet synchronous traction motors on trains is designed in [45]. This module adopts sliding mode observers to reconstruct the current sensor fault signals. The module can monitor the possible failures of the system current sensors, and the failure severity and types can also be judged according to the reconstructed fault signals. A sliding mode current observer is designed in αβ coordinates to eliminate the effects of unknown disturbances in [46], then the phase current sensor faults are reconstructed by means of an adaptive method. This method not only can accurately identify and reconstruct intermittent offset faults, slowly varying offset faults and abrupt gain faults in real-time, but also the sliding mode observer has better robustness to inaccurate mathematical models, external disturbances, and parameter perturbation.These model-based methods for current sensor fault diagnosis share the same problem in that a motor control model is required, and the diagnosis accuracy is related to the accuracy of the motor parameters.Another current sensor fault diagnosis methods do not require the motor model. A simple and effective method is proposed in [47] for current sensor fault diagnosis according to the basic idea that the phase current sum is zero for three-phase motors. This method only requires the measured phase current，which can not only locate the faulty current sensor, but can also identify the fault modes of the current sensor. A signal-based analysis for the diagnosis of current sensor faults in permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives is presented in [48]. Contrary to classical approaches for sensor fault diagnosis, based on residual generation through observers, the signal based uses only three-phase currents to define three diagnostic variables, and is suitable for such occasions where the motor parameters change greatly. The proposed diagnosis method requires low computational resources, and no detection thresholds are needed, since only the signs of the diagnostic variables are used. Neural network and fuzzy control technology are also widely applied in current sensor fault diagnosis. An artificial neural network is used for current sensor fault diagnosis, and the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm is adopted to train the internal neural network in [49], which considers the motor speed change. A fuzzy-based sensor validation strategy for AC motor drives is proposed in [50], and the major difference between the proposed method and the traditional method is that the thresholds for sensor validation are dynamically generated via uncertainty propagation, rather than being predetermined.4.2. Speed Sensor Fault DiagnosisIn speed sensor fault diagnosis, model-based fault diagnosis methods also rely on the motor control model. They generally judge whether a speed sensor is faulty, by comparing the observer output signal with the actual speed. The observer can be constructed through different methods, such as the extended Kalman filtering method [51], the Luenberger observer [52], and the model reference adaptive observer [53]. The estimated current no longer matches the actual value in fault condition, and this can be easily expanded to speed sensorless control. The main disadvantages of such techniques are that they are complex and dependent on systems parameters. Fault diagnosis methods of speed sensors were compared, based on the MRAS and artificial neural network in asynchronous motors, in [54]. It was concluded that the difference between the detection time for both algorithms was very slight. An online fault detection diagnosis method of two channel speed sensors based on the radial basis function neural network is presented in Figure 8. This method works by selecting the measured output of the speed sensor at the first k moments as the input vectors of the Radial Basis Function neural network predictor, compared to the predicted value of the speed sensor output to at the next moment, carry out fault diagnosis. The advantage of an artificial neural network is that it has parallel distribution processing ability, and can fully approximate complex nonlinear relationships. The disadvantages of neural networks are that they require a large number of parameters, and need long learning time.Open in a separate windowFigure 8Schematic diagram for speed sensor fault detection based on the neural network algorithm.4.3. Temperature Sensor Fault DiagnosisTrains suffer from severe vibrations during operation, which can cause temperature sensor faults (e.g., open or short circuits). Thus, detecting temperature sensor faults is necessary. The temperature model is complex, such that the fault diagnosis methods are mainly independent from the models. Temperature sensor faults are generally classified into two types. The first type is a sensor with saturation output. These faults can be rapidly identified, but their true temperature value is difficult to reconstruct. The second fault still has inexact measured outputs that change with the temperature as shown in Figure 5. The A2 or B2-open fault only means that the measured value will deviate from the normal value. At this point, the real temperature in such fault conditions can be obtained by means of data fitting to reconstruct real temperature values. 5. Intelligent Sensor TechnologyThe development of intelligence, networking, and automation of rail transit systems has required the use of sensors with high precision and reliability in the field. Data processing capabilities such as self-inspection, self-calibration, and self-compensation are also necessary for sensors. Traditional sensors cannot meet these requirements, whereas intelligent sensors [55] with microprocessors and integrated sensors can process the input data and transmit the relevant information to external users. Intelligent sensors represent the development direction of the next generation of sensors.5.1. Technical Features of Intelligent SensorsThe intelligent sensor has a built-in microprocessor, and its structure is shown in Figure 9. Its working mode changes from passive measure to active measure, unlike traditional sensors. The sensor also has two technology features. The first feature is that it has data processing capacities, such as self-diagnosis, self-correction, self-learning, and self-adaption [56]. Its second feature is that it has a network interface [57].Open in a separate windowFigure 9Structure chart of intelligent sensors.An intelligent sensor can implement the conversion between analog/digital quantities and complete acquisition and processing, by virtue of its built-in AD converter and microprocessor. In particular, digital filtering, nonlinear compensation, zero drift, and temperature compensation, as well as self-diagnosis and self-protection, are implemented. The embedded microprocessor structure of an intelligent sensor can also provide it with features of advanced function. Thus, advanced algorithms can be adopted such that the sensor can learn, conduct fault diagnosis, and reconstruct the measured signal according to a certain behavioral standard. These capabilities largely improve sensor reliability and measurement accuracy.Networking is the second main feature of intelligent sensors, which can use standardized bus or wireless network interfaces to establish communication among intelligent sensors, and between the intelligent sensors and main controller. Therefore, this not only can implement the digitalization of transmission signals, but also can easily expand the system. With the development of network-based sensors, intelligent sensors data have no spatial limit. Hence, manufacturers can diagnose sensor faults in a timely manner and guide users to immediate troubleshooting.5.2. Key Technology of Intelligent SensorsThe key technology of intelligent sensors according to the signal flow order can be analyzed in three aspects: signal sensing and integration technology, signal processing technology, and signal transmission technology.5.2.1. Signal Sensing and Integration TechnologyIntelligent sensors can be produced by integrating sensitive elements, a signal processing circuit, and a micro-processing unit on a chip with silicon material based on micro- electromechanical system (MEMS) technology, and large scale integrated circuit technology [58]. In [59], a software-programmable mixed-signal embedded platform for intelligent sensor interfacing with limited complexity, suitable for automotive applications, has been proposed. It has a cost-effective design of fusion algorithms, and relevant prototyping implementation on a mixed-signal acquisition hardware platform, including a configurable analog front end, analog-to-digital converters, on-chip digital processing, and communication resources. The development of multi-sensor integration technology has also enabled the integration of multi-sensitive elements on the same chip to attain a comprehensive measure. This integrated sensor has the advantages of smaller volume, lower cost and higher reliability, and all the sensor data processing function can be implemented in this new sensor.5.2.2. Signal Processing Technology Signal processing technology can be improved from two aspects of chip design and algorithm design. In terms of intelligent sensor design, a novel design platform, called SensASIP, for sensor conditioning devices, suitable for automotive applications, is proposed in [60] in order to reduce the cost and static power consumption of traditional application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) sensors. It is a design platform targeting a microprocessor architecture enhanced by dedicated instructions for computing intensive sensor signal processing tasks. If the sensor integrates self-diagnostic circuit, allowing detecting fault such as over-current and over temperature to CPU by means of a digital interface, sensor fault can be detected immediately without the complicated algorithm [61]. In terms of intelligent sensor algorithm design, an intelligent sensor can integrate all types of intelligent algorithms in a micro-processor unit and accomplish its special functions [62,63]. For example, if the artificial intelligence technology is built in the sensor, then it can directly accomplish fault diagnosis and predict the key components in a train (such as the traction converter, traction transformer, traction motor, and pantograph). 5.2.3. Signal Transmission TechnologyIntelligent sensor signal transmission is the essential functions. For example, the safety and reliability are critical for the railway applications, so the predictive diagnosis for traction system is an important means for safety and reliability. Predictive diagnosis of high-power transformer faults by networking vibration measuring nodes is proposed in [64,65], where vibration-based mechanical stress diagnosis is implemented together with electrical (voltage, current, impedance) and thermal degradation analysis. The diagnostic system is achieved through a distributed network of measuring nodes. Wireless signal transmission is also a research hotspot in current intelligent sensors [66]. In recent years, the wireless sensor network technology has been rapidly developed [67]. Wireless sensor network integrates sensor technology, wireless communication technology and distributed information processing technology and so on. The research direction focuses on different aspects, such as compatibility to any other network or interface, security and low power consumption. The security requirements of wireless sensor networks are based on their own conditions, which is the biggest difference from the general wireless communication networks. The research of wireless sensor network security mainly includes the various threats that sensor networks are confronted, the schemes of pairwise key management in sensor networks, the protocol of encryption for security [68]. There are few researches on the security of train sensor networks, but the research in other fields has already been carried out. Security issues of a home area network which is the network of communicating loads, sensors, and appliances within the customer’s premises for smart grid have been discussed in [69]. Some solutions are proposed in order to define a high-level architecture implementing privacy and security techniques in the grid. 6. Future Research Hotspots and Challenges on Railway Transit SensorWith the development of high speed and heavy duty train, the electromagnetic environment is becoming more and more complicated. The traditional electrical type sensors are becoming difficult to meet the demand of electromagnetic interference and insulation performance. Therefore, researchers have paid more attention to the new sensors in rail transit, such as the optical fiber sensors. The optical fiber sensor has good electromagnetic interference and insulation performance, suitable for measuring the temperature and the speed of the train. Fiber grating sensor has the advantages of high sensitivity, small size, the ability to contact network, so it can be used for health monitoring of train, bridges and tunnels. There are still some issues that need to be dealt with, such as feature extraction and demodulation, and cost reduction.The intelligence, integration and digitalization of sensors are the important technology for the safety of the railway traffic equipment, and it also the key technology of rail transit equipment upgrade. Using new materials and new structures to develop integration, intelligence, low power consumption and high reliability sensors is the hotspot and trend of the research. With the continuous development of ASIC chip design technology, MEMS technology and the intelligent material technology, the intelligent sensor will be further improved.Rail transit trains form a large and complex system, which requires the coordinated work of all subsystems. Wireless sensor network is composed of a large number of sensor nodes, which can quickly form an adaptive network topology for cooperative sensing and processing of distributed dynamic information. Through wireless sensor networks, the decentralization subsystem signal data can become interconnected and coordinated. Network architecture, routing algorithms, data fusion, data security, and other key technologies need to be further researched. 7. ConclusionsThe efficient, safe, and intelligent running of rail transit trains cannot be separated from the comprehensive sensing of the entire system. Large numbers of different sensor types will be applied on trains in the future. However, train onboard space is limited, and the working environment is relatively complicated. Future sensors must have the following technical features to meet the aforementioned demands: utilization of microchip-based sensors to break through space constraints, employment of compound sensors to attain efficient sensing and high-cost performance, and adoption of wireless digital sensors to accomplish the efficient transmission of sensor data. Miniaturized, multi-functional, intelligent, and networked sensors are the trend of future sensor developments.",1   introductionrail transit becom wide util mean transport   1 2   owe larg capac

IntroductionThe invention of the cash register, dated around the end of the 19th century, responded to the need for quicker and more accurate ways of providing summaries of daily transactions at points of sale [1]. Mechanical cash registers improved continuously during the following years, but it was not until the decade of 1950s and 1960s when the introduction of electronic cash registers took place.During the last decades, the improvements added to cash registers have not been significant. Nevertheless, new products intended to improve and facilitate the use and control of money have appeared, as is the case of the currency-counting machine [2]. The continued development of technology enables the emergence of new products as well as the enhancement of those already in the market. Thus, it is possible to find works related to optimization of the use of cash registers in malls [3] or patents focused on identifying the cashier, the customer, the type of operation, etc. [4,5]. There are also many papers in the literature dealing with currency recognition using machine vision [6,7,8,9], but they all need the coins or banknotes to be distinctly placed on a surface suitable for the camera to detect them. Some of these recognition systems can operate properly if the coins/banknotes are moving on a conveyor, but that is not what happens in stores and supermarkets. Other works describe systems that succeed in identifying the currency going through some kind of slot [10,11], which also allows for accurate accounting of this money.There are not, however, so many works related to counting the money once it is inside the drawers of such cash register machines. This is important not only in terms of accounting (so as to know the amount of money available in the cash machines at any given time), but also in order to guarantee that shortages in cash registers are avoided. This is a problem that has always concerned the owners of this type of business, but so far solutions have mostly come in terms of organization strategies [12,13]; not many technological solutions (if any) have been proposed to address this issue.This paper aims to present the development of a prototype for a new product capable of counting the exact amount of money inside the cash drawer in real-time, thus combining features of both cash registers and currency-counting machines. Depending on the accuracy of the system designed, its functionality will allow it to carry out accounting tasks or be limited to warn about possible shortage situations in the cash registers.Also, the rise in the use of wireless communication systems, together with the growing interest in low-power and portable devices, have been taken into consideration during the design of the prototype. Even though products with similar characteristics can already be found in the market [14], they are bulky and expensive (mainly focused on large supermarket chains or alike). In this sense, the prototype proposed in this paper also aims to prove the feasibility of a manageable and low-cost solution, which would increase its scope of application.With regards to the distribution of the money within the cash drawer and based on today’s commercial products, it has been chosen to divide the cash drawer into 12 different compartments: one for each euro coin denomination (eight in total) and the other four intended for 5€, 10€, 20€ and 50€ banknotes. In any case, an extension to more compartments could be added in a simple way.According to this, the major contributions to be conveyed by this work can be summarized as follows:Development of a novel capacitive sensor meant to count banknotes in a cash drawer.Integration of the developed sensor with other well-known solutions to count coins and widely-used wireless communication systems in order to produce a joint cash-count system.Contribution to avoiding the problem of shortages in cash registers. Possibility to develop a real-time accounting system if enough accuracy is obtained.Validation of the performance of the capacitive sensor developed by means of tests that confirm the accuracy and repeatability of the measurement. 2. System OverviewAs it has been mentioned in the previous section, the aim of this work is to develop a solution for counting both coins and banknotes in real-time. Therefore, it is essential to find a physical property and, consequently, a sensor that allows different coins and banknotes to be identified.The most noteworthy physical aspects of coins are their diameter, thickness, and weight. Since the Euro has been chosen as the reference, it can be seen from Table 1 that the diameter and weight are different for each coin. Considering that prior actions like sorting would be necessary in the case of selecting the diameter as the differentiating feature, the weight has resulted to be the most suitable option.Table 1Features of the Euro Coins.Value (€)Diameter (mm)Thickness (mm)Weight (g)0.0116.251.672.300.0218.751.673.060.0521.251.673.920.1019.751.934.100.2022.252.145.740.5024.252.387.80123.252.337.50225.752.208.50Open in a separate windowThe viability of the commercial solutions proposed this far regarding the counting of banknotes [15] is limited to some extent. That is why instead of trying to identify the number of banknotes by means of a direct measurement of a physical feature such as their size or colour [16] as indicated in Table 2, it has been decided that banknotes be used as a means to affect or influence an auxiliary, measurable property. In this way, an alternative to the previous methods is unveiled and will be further analysed in Section 4.Table 2Features of the Euro Banknotes.Value (€)Size (mm)Colour5120 × 62Grey10127 × 67Red20133 × 72Blue50140 × 77Orange100147 × 82Green200153 × 82Yellow-brown500160 × 82PurpleOpen in a separate windowAny measurement taken from the real world and intended for further usage into a digital system must be processed to some extent. This process is known as Data Acquisition (DAQ) and it comprises all steps from the measurement of the physical phenomenon to the processing of these data by the system, e.g., a computer or a microcontroller. The details of the DAQ processes needed to obtain the data from the sensors are included in Section 3 and Section 4.Nevertheless, it does not matter whether the data from the real world can either be obtained or processed if they cannot be accessed afterwards. That is the reason communications play a key role in most of the systems. Taking into consideration the main objectives of the prototype, a wireless communication and, more precisely Bluetooth technology, has been chosen as the preferred option. The absence of cables increases the manageability of the product and simplifies its mechanical design. Additionally, using Bluetooth technology eliminates the need to acquire a specific piece of equipment to receive the information provided by the system, for most secondary devices such as smartphones, tablets or computers include Bluetooth modules that allow for interoperability with the prototype designed [17].At this point, the fundamental pillars of the prototype and the technologies that will be used in the design stage have been analysed and defined respectively. 3. Coins Calculation SystemAs previously mentioned, the solution proposed in this paper uses the weight as the differentiating feature between coins. There are already commercial products that use this method to count the number of coins or other items [18]. Due to the existing direct proportionality between force and mass, a force sensor has been chosen to measure the weight.Among all different kinds of force sensors, strain gauges’ load cells are the most widely used in the implementation of small, high-precision scales. The beam or structural element of the load cell needs to be selected depending on the force the load cell will be submitted to. In the case of a scale, the forces acting on the load cell are unidirectional and therefore, a single-bending beam load cell is enough.Since each coin denomination has a different weight, it might seem that a single load cell would be enough to count all the money. However, this solution has many drawbacks, including the fact that it would be impossible to calculate the initial amount of money after rebooting the system or checking whether a coin has been placed in its corresponding compartment, among others. Therefore, it has been decided that one load cell sensor CZS639M [19] be used for each coin compartment, eight in total. Even though both the electrical and mechanical design of the prototype becomes more challenging like this, the capabilities of the system increase.Figure 1 shows the detail of the assembly of each of the load cells in the drawer (top picture); the fixed end is fastened to a support, while the free end is cantilevered to allow downward deflection as the load is applied. The bottom picture (Figure 1) shows the coin compartment fitted on the load cell; in this way, the compartment (weight is 43 g) and the coins inside act vertically downwards. The load cell support and the coin compartment have been custom-designed and manufactured using a 3D printer. More details about mechanical design are included in Section 5 of this paper.Open in a separate windowFigure 1Load cell mount (top) and coins compartment assembly (bottom).The variation of the electrical resistance in the strain gauges can be measured by means of a Wheatstone bridge. In those cases where it is possible to have strain gauges subjected to both tension and compression due to symmetry, as it is the case in the proposed system, the configuration shown in Figure 2 is the most suitable one. The output voltage of this setup, expressed by (1), follows a linear evolution with respect to the applied force and its sensitivity is up to four times higher in comparison with other configurations. Vout = (ΔR/R)·Vin(1)Open in a separate windowFigure 2Four-point bridge sensor.This solution to determine the number of coins in a separate compartment (using a strain gauge and a Wheatstone bridge to weigh them) is definitely not unknown to researchers in the field. In fact, this is but an implementation of an invention protected by US patent number 5,756,977 [20]; an implementation of this idea has also been protected by means of US patent number 10,127,776 [21]. Yet, it has been included in the paper so as to present the overall integration of the system, which uses different approaches to reach the final goal of the prototype as a whole.It is usually far more challenging (and not at all mentioned in the patent indicated above) to amplify the typically low signals to values that can be easily handled by the processing system. In this case, the main characteristics of the selected load cell for our prototype are: rated load 200 g; sensitivity 0.6 mV/V; supply voltage 5 V to 10 V and nonlinearity ± 0.03%F.S. The magnitude of the bridge output voltage, as expected, does not exceed a few millivolts and, therefore, a high amplification gain needs to be added in the DAQ process.The differential nature of the output signal coming from the bridge makes it necessary to use a differential input amplifier. Given the need for high-precision resistors and the reduced dimensions of the setup, an instrumentation amplifier is the most suitable choice for the goal of the project.The instrumentation amplifier selected for the development of the project is the AD627 from Analog Devices [22]. Especially designed for transducer interfacing, its micropower consumption makes it suitable for portable battery-powered instruments and is capable of providing large gains without the need to include additional filtering stages. The selection of the gain depends on the input and output voltage ranges required for the application. In this case, it has been decided to adjust the gain so that a load of 200 g does not exceed the maximum reference voltage for the Analog to Digital Converter (3.3 V). One of the remarkable features of the AD627 is the possibility to adjust the gain by changing the value of only one external resistor. A 935 gain has been finally chosen and the performance of the setup is summarized in Figure 3. The presence of a non-zero voltage value without coins (0.5 V) is due to the weight of the compartment.Open in a separate windowFigure 3Graphical representation of the in-amp output voltage as a function of weight.The voltage at the output of the instrumentation amplifier is connected to a microcontroller analog input. Since these devices are only capable of handling digital data, information contained in analog signals requires a previous conversion. Even though there are individual integrated circuits intended only to implement such an analog-to-digital conversion, the process is so common that most of the microcontrollers include an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) module. In the development of this solution, the 12-bits ADC module integrated in the microcontroller chosen has been used, thus reducing the complexity of the system. 4. Banknotes Calculation SystemThere already exist solutions capable of counting the exact amount of money in banknotes, but they are quite bulky and slow [23]. US patent number 5,756,977 mentioned earlier [20] suggests that banknotes in cash drawers can also be counted from their weight; however, very sensitive load cells are needed in this case and the presence of used bills can cause significant errors. The patent itself states that “although procedures for counting them by weighing which are accurate have been developed, (…) this may be at the cost of a higher cost of the system.”Thus, an alternative method, other than weighing them, is proposed in this paper to identify the number of banknotes present in the cash drawer. The key factor of this alternative method has to do with the properties the material banknotes are made of, pure cotton-fibre, which in turn results in being a dielectric material. The basic idea consists in placing the banknotes between two conductive plates; a change in the quantity of banknotes will lead to a variation of the capacitance between these two plates. Since all materials have a relative permeability or dielectric constant greater than unity, the capacitance will always be increased by inserting a dielectric. ε = ε0 · εr(2) where: ε absolute permittivity of free space (F/m)ε0 permittivity of free space (F/m)εr relative permittivity (1)Even though the relative permittivity of the dielectric material depends on many factors including temperature, pressure and frequency, the application proposed in this report does not imply significant variations in those properties. Thus, by keeping the surface of the parallel plates constant, the capacitance of the capacitor depends on the distance between the plates only (3) and, therefore, on the amount of banknotes between them. C = (A · ε)/d(3) where: C capacitance (F)A surface of the plates (m2)ε absolute permittivity (F/m)d distance between plates (m)In a cash drawer, there is a little tray for each kind of banknote. In each of these compartments, there is a spring and a metal clip that presses the banknotes together. In our case, a new mechanical design adapted to the existing metal clip and spring has been developed. In order to do so, a new bill holder has been designed and manufactured using a 3D printer (see Section 5, Section 5.4). This new element can hold the top conductive plate of the parallel plate capacitor while guaranteeing no electrical contact with the metal clip. Note that direct contact between the metal clip and the top conductive plate must be avoided, since both elements are conductive and such a contact might affect the expected value of capacitance. Physical implementation of the other conductive plate (that opposite to the one mounted on the bill holder) is achieved by gluing it directly on the cash drawer, since the bottom of the cash drawer is completely flat and made of non-conductive materials.Figure 4 shows the arrangement of the two conductive plates and the new bill holder designed.Open in a separate windowFigure 4Adapted compartment without banknotes (left) and with 20 euro banknotes (right).To ensure that every Euro banknote fills the space between the plates regardless of its position in the compartment and to facilitate the introduction and withdrawal of the bills, the conductive plates were built 40 mm in width and 35 mm in length (Figure 5). As far as the material used for these plates is concerned, 1-mm-thick copper foil was used due to its being readily available.Open in a separate windowFigure 5Dimensions of the conductive plates compared to a 5€ banknote.With the aid of an impedance analyser, the capacitance of the capacitor formed by the two parallel copper plates was measured for different number of bills. The results obtained are shown in Figure 6. Further analysis of the data is included in Section 7. The system to develop must be able to identify these capacitance variations and, hence, derive the number of banknotes inside the compartment.Open in a separate windowFigure 6Evolution of the capacitance depending on the banknote value.Some of the simplest capacitance meters are based on the time it takes to charge a capacitor. Assuming the capacitor is included in an RC circuit where the value of R is known, it is possible to calculate the capacitance out of the charging time of the capacitor. This method, though simple, holds several inaccuracies related to knowing the exact value of the resistor or precisely determining the final voltage across the capacitor.Aiming to increase the robustness and reliability of the system, an alternative based on an oscillatory circuit has been considered in this paper. By measuring the frequency of the signal produced in such a circuit, it is possible to determine the value of the capacitor included in it. There are several topologies that can provide an oscillatory output like the one needed; Figure 7 shows the one used in the design presented in this paper.Open in a separate windowFigure 7Multi-vibrator circuit (CT depends on the amount of banknotes between plates).The design of the topology in Figure 7 is a typical application of the MCP6543 comparator from a Microchip, optimized for low-power applications. It should be noticed that this integrated circuit includes an enable pin (Chip Select), thus allowing for an even larger reduction of its consumption.To design a multi-vibrator such as the one in Figure 7, the first step is to choose the value of the resistors R1, R2 and R3, which form the hysteresis feedback path. These resistors are closely related to the threshold voltages, VTH and VTL, whose values must be evenly spaced within the common mode range of the comparator and centered on VDC/2.To limit the power dissipation in R1 and R2, the continuous current flowing through them must be reduced and thus, their value should be greater than 1 kΩ. In addition to that, large values of R3 (100 kΩ–10 MΩ) can produce voltage offsets at the non-inverting input due to the comparator’s input bias current. For the above reasons, it has been decided to use 10 kΩ resistors in the hysteresis feedback path. The remaining components of the topology, RT and CT, form a time delay network between the output and the inverting input, which consequently determines the oscillation frequency. Figure 8 shows the most important waveforms obtained in the circuit of Figure 7.Open in a separate windowFigure 8Waveforms at the non-inverting input and at the output of the comparator.In the end, the mathematical expression that relates the oscillation frequency of the output, Fosc, and the capacitance, CT, is given by (4). Fosc=12·RT·CT·ln(VTHVTL)(4)Since the capacitance of the parallel plate capacitor has been found to be in the order of picofarads (Figure 6), and aiming to obtain oscillation frequencies around tens of kHz, a 10 kΩ resistor has been chosen for RT. In this way, Figure 9 represents variations of the oscillation frequency as different banknotes are placed in between the parallel plate capacitor, thus proving the feasibility of the proposed solution.Open in a separate windowFigure 9Evolution of the oscillation frequency according to the number of banknotes.This oscillation frequency is measured by a microcontroller that, using an internal counter module and an internal timer module, counts the number of cycles of the waveform generated per unit of time. The system described in this work comprises four oscillatory waveforms: one associated to each of the four banknote compartments considered (5€, 10€, 20€ and 50€). In order to minimize the resources required from the processing unit or microcontroller, a 4:1 multiplexer has been included in the electric circuit so that all the four waveforms can be multiplexed into the microcontroller, hence requiring only one counter module and one timer from the microcontroller. The multiplexer selected is ADG704 from Analog Devices, a CMOS analog multiplexer comprising four single channels [24]. Additionally, its single supply range and enable pin make it ideal for battery-powered instruments.It must be clarified that the graph in Figure 9 shows the average frequency observed for each bank denomination and for different quantities. Actual data collected during the tests revealed that the frequency dispersion obtained remains within acceptable limits. For the same quantity of any given banknote denomination, several tests have been repeated to obtain the average frequency shown in Figure 9. In this way, the standard deviation obtained is always below 48 Hz. Since the frequencies produced by the system are around 90 kHz, this yields a measurement error of only 0.05%. Thus, it can be concluded that the current approach is capable of identifying different quantities of banknotes even if, because of their being worn out or wrinkled, they would show a slightly different change in their equivalent capacitance.Furthermore, the differences in the frequencies generated for 6 banknotes with respect to the ones generated for 7 banknotes are still in the order of a few hundreds of hertz (the exact number varying depending on the banknote denomination) and the differences from 9 to 10 banknotes are still around 100 Hz. Given the measurement error indicated above, these frequency variations are suitable to easily identify these one-banknote increments.At this point of the design, the data coming from the sensors are ready to be further processed. In the next Section, the integration of all the elements that make up the prototype is discussed. 5. System IntegrationThe proper functioning of the prototype proposed in this paper highly depends on the integration of all the different parts. So far, only the data acquisition system has been discussed. In this Section, the remaining elements needed to fully develop the prototype are included.5.1. Central Processing UnitAll components mentioned so far are essential for both collecting and transmitting data, but, up to this point, these two actions are unconnected. There exists a need for a nexus between them, solved by means of a processing unit capable of receiving data through its input pins, processing them and generating other data that can either be stored or driven to any of its output pins.Based on the little space available, the low-power requirement of the prototype and its low cost, a Microchip PIC24F32KA302 microcontroller has been chosen as the processing unit for the prototype. As well as some general I/O pins to control the position of the cash drawer and to control the external multiplexer indicated above, the microcontroller used must include the following internal modules: an analog-to-digital converter that receives the voltage representative of the coins’ weight; a counter and a timer to count the number of cycles of the waveform associated to the number of banknotes per unit of time; and a Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) that enables serial communication with a Bluetooth module in order to send the information to a portable device.An overview of the complete system is included in Figure 10.Open in a separate windowFigure 10System overview.In addition to the core functionalities of the prototype, additional features have been implemented so as to facilitate its utilization. Knowing that the status of the cash drawer (whether it is open or closed) simplifies the functioning of system to a large extent, measurements must only be made whenever the cash drawer is closed. In such a way, it has been decided to include a limit switch as an external interrupt source for the microcontroller. Every time the limit switch is activated, an event is triggered and the data acquisition of the sensors is started.Another feature that has not been previously mentioned, but which is extremely common in today’s cash registers, is the possibility to automatically open the cash drawer whenever a transaction needs to be done. This feature has also been implemented in the prototype. The actuator that pushes the cash drawer out is an electromagnet driven by a general I/O of the microcontroller.5.2. CommunicationsThe microcontroller selected, which includes a serial communication module, makes it possible to transmit the sensor data as well as remotely interact with the prototype. In Section 2, the use of Bluetooth technology was already justified and based on those arguments; a commercial HC-05 Bluetooth Serial Port Protocol (SPP) module has been integrated into the system. By using this module, the implementation of Bluetooth communication is largely simplified, since it can be directly connected to any Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) module of the microcontroller. Thus, it is the HC-05 that is in charge of implementing all the Bluetooth communication protocol, making it transparent for the developer of the application and the programmer of the microcontroller unit, who will only have to decide the information to be shared.In order not to allow the data to be accessed from any device in the surroundings, the communication has been password protected. The range of the communications is another factor that should be considered when designing the system. Several tests have been carried out with the prototype developed and the range oscillates from 15 m to 50 m, depending on the presence of obstacles.5.3. Power ManagementIn the last years, Universal Serial Bus (USB) has evolved from a data interface capable of supplying limited power to a primary provider of power with a data interface. Thus, many small devices charge or get their power from USB ports [25]. Because of that, a Micro USB Type B connector has been included in the design of the prototype.According to the USB 3.1 Specification, the voltage supplied by any host (computer, external battery, …) can vary from 4.45 V to 5.25 V. Either way, the voltage provided by the host will be the supply voltage for the whole system [13]. However, not all the components previously selected have the same supply voltages and, therefore, a power management system is required. The overview of the system implemented in the prototype, which consists of first getting a 5-volt regulated voltage and 3.3 V afterwards, is shown in Figure 11.Open in a separate windowFigure 11Structure of the power supply system.Since the USB voltage can be either higher or lower than the desired 5 V, an S7V7F5 step-up/step-down regulator from Pololu has been used [26]. As indicated in Figure 11, this switching regulator can operate from input voltages between 2.7 V and 11.8 V, which extends the capabilities of the system designed: Not only can it operate when connected to a USB port, but also when supplied by many other DC sources, including batteries.Once the regulated 5-volt voltage is available, different approaches can be followed to obtain 3.3 V out of it. Even though the efficiency of a switching regulator is higher than that of a Low Drop Out (LDO) regulator, the smaller size, lower quiescent current IQ, and easier implementation of the LDO turn it into the preferred option. Specifically, the regulator chosen is the TPS79733DC from Texas Instruments, a Low-Dropout Linear Regulator with ultra-low IQ intended for use in microcontroller-based, battery-powered applications [27].5.4. Mechanical DesignCash registers available in the market today do not have a mechanical design that allows the implementation of the sensors required for the proper functioning of the prototype. Therefore, a commercial design of a cash drawer had to be modified, so that it could integrate all the instrumentation. All the mechanical parts of the prototype were manufactured using a Flashforge Creator Pro 3D printer [28] because of its speed, low cost and instant availability. Figure 12 shows the piece designed to attach one of the coin compartments with its corresponding load cell. In the same way, the mechanical part designed and manufactured to fix the top conductive plate of each of the capacitive sensor, is shown in Figure 13.Open in a separate windowFigure 123D rendering of the assembly between a coin compartment and the workpiece designed for the union between compartments and load cells.Open in a separate windowFigure 133D rendering of the workpiece the conductive plate of the parallel capacitor is glued to. This is an element of the new bill holder.5.5. PCB DesignThis Subsection covers the design of a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) that will integrate all different components, as well as the necessary connectors, in the most convenient way. In addition to that, possible constraints imposed by the mechanical design made in the previous section have also been considered. Based on these limitations, the next step consists in defining the arrangement of all different components and connectors in the most compact way over the PCB. This step, as well as the routing of all tracks, has been carried out using Altium Designer.The PCB is located under the coin compartments as shown in Figure 14. The headers meant to connect the load cells and the parallel plate capacitors to the PCB have been placed so as to minimize the distance between the sensors and the PCB, thus preventing the appearance of electromagnetic interference. Also, the PCB has been designed so that the two independent modules corresponding to the step-up/step-down converter and the Bluetooth communication can be accommodated within the available space of the PCB, thus resulting in a more compact design.Open in a separate windowFigure 14Cash drawer layout (350 mm × 300 mm) and PCB (60 mm × 100 mm) location.This completes the definition of the hardware of the system, which has been fully described. In the following Section, both the design and implementation of the software will be carried out. 6. Software Development6.1. Microcontroller ProgramIn a previous Section, a microcontroller PIC24F32KA302 from Microchip was selected as the central processing unit of the system. In this Section, the design of the program that will allow this microcontroller to receive and process the data needed to fulfil the objectives of this project will be covered.The program can be divided into two main parts: (a) initialization and configuration of all different modules of the microcontroller, and (b) definition of all the procedures undertaken during the execution of the main loop.Assuming the cash drawer will be opened for inserting or withdrawing money, it can be stated that the amount of money deposited inside the cash drawer will only need to be measured once each time the cash drawer is closed. The opening action of the cash drawer can either be manual or automatic, thanks to the implementation of an electromagnet which is activated through Bluetooth from the user’s device. Hence, the program must be continuously checking for data received through the serial port. That is the only task performed in the main loop of the program, as all the other actions have been programmed to be handled by means of interrupt events. In the prototype developed, three events have been identified: opening the cash drawer, calibrating the system and updating the amount of money available in the cash register.No matter how the cash drawer has been opened, whenever it is closed again a measurement must start. As soon as the cash drawer is closed, a limit switch will trigger an interrupt in the microcontroller that marks the beginning for the measurements.In the interrupt service routine associated to the closing of the cash drawer, analog to digital conversions are carried out by means of the A/D module of the microcontroller and, at the same time, the oscillation frequency is being measured. Figure 15 shows a flow diagram illustrating the main tasks included in the main program and those associated to the execution of the interrupt service routine that is run when the cash drawer is closed.Open in a separate windowFigure 15Flow diagram of (a) the main program of the microcontroller, and (b) the interrupt service routine associated to the cash drawer being closed.According to Figure 15, as soon as all the conversions have finished, the data obtained are immediately processed. The data processing part of the program includes the transformation of the measurements taken from the real world into integer numbers, which represent the quantities of all the different coins and banknotes denominations present in the cash drawer. At this point, the need for calibration curves becomes evident. These curves play a key role in the proper functioning of the system, as they define the final results. Because of this, the calibration parameters that allow measurements to be translated into number of coins and banknotes have been saved in a non-volatile memory, such as the EEPROM included in the microcontroller.Figure 16 shows that the result of the A/D conversions is directly proportional to the number of coins and, therefore, the only parameters to obtain for the calibration curve are the slope and the intersection point with the Y-axis of the plot, which relates the number of coins and the ADC results. Assuming a linear performance of the load cells over time, the values of the slopes will remain constant. However, it is true that any variation in the weight of the empty compartment can cause an offset error. Therefore, the calibration process for the coins consists in the adjustment of the empty compartment ADC values.Open in a separate windowFigure 16Graphical representation of the analog-to-digital conversion performed by the AD module (12-bit resolution).The calibration curve used for the banknotes has not been obtained as directly as the one associated to coins, the main reason being that the oscillation frequency does not evolve linearly with the number of banknotes (see Figure 9). Because of that, a single-point or even a two-point calibration will not result in proper accuracy of the calibration curve. This is why a multiple-point calibration has been performed instead, with linear interpolation being used to calculate the intermediate points.6.2. App User InterfaceIn the previous Section, the interaction of the user through a Bluetooth-connected device has been mentioned. Controlling the prototype from a hand-held device, such as a smartphone or a tablet, is also one of the objectives of the project. Therefore, an application has been developed that will act as an interface between the prototype and the user.According to a statistical study conducted by the International Data Corporation (IDC), Android dominates the smartphone market with a share of 85% [29]. Because of that, along with the huge amount of information and resources available, Android operating system has been chosen as the preferred alternative. Among all different tools intended for the development of Android applications, MIT App Inventor was used, a development software environment created by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) [30].The main idea is to use the app as a graphical interface, so that the user can see the amount of money inside the cash drawer in real-time. In addition to that, the application must allow the user to open the cash drawer and to perform a complete calibration of the prototype at any time, as already anticipated in the previous Section of this paper.As it can be observed from the main menu shown in Figure 17, the user can act over five different buttons. The top button will open a new screen that allows users to select and connect the smartphone to any Bluetooth device detected within its Bluetooth range.Open in a separate windowFigure 17Screenshots of the Android application. From left to right, Main menu of the application, CONNECT screen, and MONEY screen.The second button of the main menu leads to another screen that allows the user to open the cash drawer remotely.It is the screen accessed through the MONEY button that shows the amount of money inside the cash drawer. A dropdown menu on the top left corner of the screen gives the user the chance to show either the amount of coins, banknotes, or the totals.A calibration of the prototype can be started by entering the SETTINGS menu and clicking the calibration button. The cash drawer will open if it was closed and several messages will pop up on the screen, guiding the user through the whole calibration process.Finally, as its name suggests, the CLOSE button will end the application. 7. Experimental ValidationThroughout the development of the complete system, the performance of different elements has been tested, and some of the most relevant results are summarized in this Section.The feasibility of the coins counting solution proposed in this paper has been proven with several tests, whose results have been presented in Figure 15. As it can be seen, there exists a linear relationship between the number of coins and the AD converter value, which makes it possible to directly determine the number of coins of each denomination. Error detection techniques could also be implemented based on the results obtained.As for the banknote counting solution, it should be noted that the capacitance varies according to the number of banknotes (see Figure 6), as expected. At least three different measurements were made for each banknote denomination. These measurements used different quantities of banknotes (from 1 to 10) and with different qualities too (new, worn, wrinkled). The tests performed revealed good accuracy and repeatability of the frequencies representing the quantity of banknotes for each denomination. Table 3 illustrates this by showing the average value and the standard deviation obtained for the different denominations and for quantities up to 10 units. The low values obtained for the standard deviation prove the goodness of the method defined.Table 3Frequencies measured for each banknote denomination.No. of Units5€10€20€50€µ (Hz)σ (%)µ (Hz)σ (%)µ (Hz)σ (%)µ (Hz)σ (%)189,4320.041896080.01588,3720.03088,9020.055292,9900.00792,0410.01791,0840.00592,9250.022394,0900.01393,6540.00792,6640.02293,9660.017494,7820.03194,5840.01293,5330.01394,7380.030595,2460.02895,0790.00894,2070.01595,1420.002695,7910.00695,4720.00394,7500.02195,3960.012796,2530.00795,9690.00295,2280.01095,7400.018896,3310.01096,1410.01195,8560.01395,8060.013996,6050.00896,4780.00796,0130.02496,1100.0211096,7830.01496,6680.00496,2190.01696,1850.025Open in a separate windowIt has been observed during the tests that placing a banknote in different positions with respect to the parallel plates produces small variations in the capacitance, thus introducing a limitation to the solution proposed. Because of that, all the experiments have been performed by keeping the relative position between the parallel plates of the capacitor and the banknotes constant. This constraint should not pose any limitation to the application of the measurement method described in this work, since the four compartments meant to store the banknotes will contribute to placing them in the appropriate position.Another conclusion that can be derived from the data collected by the sensors is that the size of the different banknote denominations has an effect over the capacitance. Although this fact has not been taken into consideration in the prototype developed, it could be used to identify different banknote denominations placed in the same compartment.Additional tests have been performed in order to check other functionalities of the system. For instance, as mentioned in Section 5.2, the range of the Bluetooth module has been tested. This was done by transferring a known number of data packages between a secondary device and the prototype. Up to 50 m away (without obstacles), all the packages sent were correctly received at their destination; this determined the maximum distance the system will be reliable at.Since the prototype has also been designed with the capability to be a portable device, its average consumption was also measured. The measurement was performed with all the peripherals enabled, and the average current was found to be less than 100 mA. 8. ConclusionsIn this project, a cash register prototype capable of automatically counting the amount of money deposited inside has been developed. Each time the cash drawer is closed, a measurement procedure starts. The development of the prototype may be split into two different subsystems, one in charge of counting the number of different coins, and the other in charge of counting the number of banknotes.The solution proposed for counting the coins is based on the working principle of a scale. By means of load cells, each coin denomination is weighted individually using a different coin compartment, thus allowing error detection in the introduction or withdrawal of money as well as simplifying the software implementation.With regard to the banknotes, an innovative solution based on capacitance measurement has been developed. No record or precedent of an implementation of a banknote-counting sensor like the one presented in this paper has been found. Capacitive measurement of distances is a well-known technique but, to the knowledge of the authors of this work, has not been used before to determine the number of banknotes in a compartment. The tests performed have determined that the implementation of the sensor carried out allows identifying at least 10 banknotes of each denomination. Currently, its usage leads to a limitation associated to the way the banknote is deposited in the compartment. Nonetheless, further testing and development of the solution may overcome this constraint.This solution is easily adapted to currencies from different countries by simply including in the microcontroller program the data that relates weight with number of coins and frequency with number of banknotes. This is done by means of parameters and lookup tables that will be stored in the non-volatile memory of the microcontroller. Although this could be accomplished through the Android application developed, it is preferable to include this information in the microcontroller firmware for the sake of security.Special attention should be paid to the Bluetooth communication link established between the cash register prototype and an Android device by means of a simple application. Although in this project it has been chosen to develop an Android application, the idea may be extrapolated to any other platform. In its current version, the prototype is meant to operate locally only, using the Android device as a simple graphical interface. However, it is possible to extend its functionality by including a Wi-Fi module (instead of the Bluetooth one) and developing a cloud application.The bill of materials for the whole prototype costs around 230€. This price includes the cost of an HS-140 Seypos cash drawer that must be modified so as to include the capacitive sensors. Also, this price does not take into account the possible price reduction that could be obtained when buying large quantities.The aspects previously mentioned set the fundamental pillars of the cash register prototype and the results obtained during testing show the feasibility of the solution proposed. In any case, further research may result in the improvement of the system performance. Author ContributionsAll the authors were involved in the research.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/29948761/,"SignificanceWhat is already known on this topic? Home visiting programs that support parenting practices for families facing risks have been linked to gains in positive parenting practices and reductions in child maltreatment. In addition, participation in evidence informed home visiting programs improves children’s developmental outcomes.What does this study add? This manuscript includes a detailed examination of the relations among specific interactions among home visitors, parents and children and home visit quality. Results of this study provide a significant contribution to professional development efforts by elucidating specific interactions differentially associated with home visit quality. IntroductionHome visiting programs are designed to promote child health and developmental outcomes among populations facing risks by increasing parent support for learning and development, promoting parent well-being, and preventing child maltreatment (Pew Home Visiting Project 2015). The ongoing Home Visiting Evidence of Effectiveness (HomVEE) review, commissioned to identify evidence-based programs and guide agencies implementing Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) programs, reflects this overall approach (Sama-Miller et al. 2017). Specifically, 20 home visiting models with demonstrated success addressing one or more of eight domains (child health; child development and school readiness; family economic self-sufficiency; linkages and referrals; maternal health; positive parenting; reductions in child maltreatment; and reductions in juvenile delinquency, family violence, and crime) have been designated as evidence-based. The current study was undertaken to look inside individual home visits, all conducted following guidelines from a model program and funded under the auspices of MIECHV, to examine active intervention ingredients used and their relations with ratings of home visit quality.Home Visiting Programs—Purposes and Theory of ChangeModel home visiting programs focus on working in the family’s home and target relationships among the child’s immediate family members based on both theoretical and empirical support. Ecobehavioral theory (Bronfenbrenner 1961, 1994) posits that child development is influenced most strongly by daily environments (e.g., interactions within the immediate family and home) and further, that supportive relationships with extended family members, a vibrant community, and family-friendly government policies can influence overall family functioning and child development positively, and has influenced practice, policy, and research over the past half century. As well, empirical knowledge about early development is expanding rapidly. Responsive and stimulating care promotes optimal child development (Bornstein and Tamis-LeMonda 1989), even in the face of risks (Egeland et al. 1993; Werner 2000), and is especially important early in life when it sets patterns for secure attachment, sensory pathways, language, and cognitive functioning (National Scientific Council on the Developing Child 2007) that will influence the individual throughout life (Collins et al. 2000).Evidence that responsive caregiving promotes healthy development is reflected in widely-used home visiting models. The majority (15 of 20) of evidence-based home visiting models (Sama-Miller et al. 2017) target caregiving directly; this reflects an underlying theory of change that enhancing parents’1 ability to provide responsive and developmentally supportive care is the active ingredient enabling home visiting programs to effect positive outcomes. Home visiting programs, however, often do not have an explicitly stated theory of change to describe specific mechanisms used to achieve intended outcomes (Weiss 1995).Home Visiting Process, Content, Quality, and OutcomesPractice recommendations (Roggman et al. 2008a) also reflect this theory of change by encouraging active engagement of parents with their children during home visits. Triadic interactions that involve the child, parent, and home visitor working collaboratively promote engagement of all participants and focus content on enhancing parent–child interaction and child development (Hughes 2005; McCollum and Yates 1994). This sets the stage for quality practices and reflects program goals across home visiting models and services.Triadic interactions, unfortunately, occur for small proportions of time during many home visits. Triadic interactions were observed 40 and 27% of the time during Part C and Early Head Start (EHS) home visits respectively (Peterson et al. 2007). Triadic interactions provide opportunities for home visitors to observe parents’ interactions with their child, but what home visitors say and do to support these interactions is key. The home visitor can model specific types of interaction strategies the parent might use when that is necessary. Likely more helpful, the home visitor can coach the parent providing specific suggestions for activities to do, specific language to use with their child and cues regarding the child’s communicative signals along with ways to respond to their child’s cues.Coaching parent–child interactions can strengthen parents’ competence for promoting their child’s development as well as boost parental confidence and enjoyment of the child. Home visits, in an EHS program, were rated as higher quality when facilitating parent–child interaction was a goal (Roggman et al. 2001). In contrast to parent education approaches that emphasize sharing developmental information by talking with parents, active coaching gives opportunities for parents to practice new activities and ways of interacting with their young children while the home visitor provides encouragement and feedback. It also affords opportunities for home visitors to identify and support parent’s recognition of and differential response to their child’s cues, which is linked to sensitive and responsive caregiving (Roggman et al. 2008a).Family engagement and a focus on child development, which are promoted with triadic interactions, were associated with more positive outcomes in EHS home visiting programs (Peterson et al. 2013; Raikes et al. 2006), perhaps in part because these same things were associated with longer duration of program enrollment (Roggman et al. 2008b). Enhanced caregiving outcomes resulting from home visiting programs have been linked to positive child development outcomes (Olds et al. 2002, 2004) with later child outcomes attributed directly to earlier caregiving outcomes among families participating in EHS home visiting programs (Raikes et al. 2014). In general, strength-based practices have been shown to promote a more supportive home environment for the child (Green et al. 2004).Research QuestionsIn the current study, direct observation, was used to relate specific home visiting strategies with quality ratings of home visits. Specific questions guiding this research included: What proportion of home visit time was spent in triadic interactions?What was the nature of the home visitor’s activity (i.e., observing, modeling, coaching) during triadic interactions?What were the unique contributions of observing, modeling and coaching to ratings of home visit quality?  MethodIowa MIECHV ProgramsIowa MIECHV programs were initiated in ten communities across the state; preliminary work by the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) identified participating communities as those with the highest proportions of families facing multiple risks (e.g., premature birth, child maltreatment, poverty, substance abuse, domestic violence). These 10 sites, across 18 counties, are home to families living in both rural and urban communities.The IDPH contracts with local agencies to deliver MIECHV services which were initiated in 2014. Agency applicants were asked to identify one of four models for implementation: EHS, Healthy Families America (HFA), Nurse Family Partnership (NFP), or Parents as Teachers (PAT). These four models are the most widely used evidence based models funded by MIECHV. In addition, each of these models targets the parent–child relationship as a primary mechanism for enhancing child development. The current study was embedded in a larger evaluation of Iowa MIECHV programs. Participation in the evaluation was voluntary for families; home visitors were required to participate in some evaluation activities based on employment status, but home visitors voluntarily consented to have data concerning their demographic information included in research examinations presented here. All activities were approved by the university’s institutional review board.ParticipantsParticipants included families who received MIECHV-funded home visiting services and their home visitors. Table 1 presents demographic information for families (1) served by MIECHV-funded programs, (2) who consented to be a part of the evaluation study, and (3) included in the final analysis sample. Groupings were not mutually exclusive; the evaluation sample and analysis sample were subsamples of MIECHV enrollees, and the analysis sample was a subsample of the evaluation sample. One-way ANOVA was used to examine primary caregiver age, household size and annual income revealing no statistically significant differences among these groups. Chi square was used to compare samples on marital status (married vs. never married), education, and race of primary caregiver (White vs. non-White). One difference was found among groups; the analysis sample included a greater proportion of caregivers who reported having at least some college than the overall MIECHV sample [χ2(4) = 19.78, p < .001]. One hundred and eight home visits, one per family, were observed (84 HFA, 10 EHS, and 14 NFP).Table 1Demographic characteristics by sample (primary caregiver data)MIECHV sample (N = 1886)Evaluation sample (n = 440)Analysis sample (n = 108)M (SD)PercentageM (SD)PercentageM (SD)PercentageAgea24.24 (6.83)23.80 (5.68)24.07 (5.84)Household income$12,897 (13,553)$13,957 (14,094)$15,373 (14,936)Household size3.25 (1.50)3.12 (1.47)3.22 (1.49)Gender (% female)999999Educationb Less than high school221713 Diploma/GED/enrolled in HS484944 At least some college283443Ethnicity (% Hispanic)141521Racec White606265 Black or African American201811 Asian/Pacific/Native320 Multiracial171824Marital statusd Never married747569 Divorced457 Separated223 Married191821Child gender (% female)e484947Open in a separate windowWhere percentages do not equal 100% there is missing data or rounding.

All 45 home visitors were female, 89% identified as White, and 75% were younger than 40. The majority spoke only English (87%) and had at least a bachelor’s degree (89%). Their average length of employment as a home visitor was 3.5 years (SD = 7.5); most home visitors had been in the field about 1 year. Number of observations per home visitor ranged from 1 to 7 (M = 2.40, SD = 1.81); more than half of home visitors (21) contributed a single video; ten contributed two videos; three contributed three, four, and five respectively; four contributed six videos; and one home visitor contributed seven videos.MeasuresFamily demographic information was collected by home visitors at program enrollment. Home visitors self-reported information about their personal characteristics, education and training. Home visitors were asked to send a video-recording of one home visit with each family annually; a staff member from the home visiting program (e.g., the home visit supervisor) recorded the visits.Observations Trained research assistants used the Home Visit Observation Form-Revised (HVOF-R: McBride and Peterson 1996) and the Home Visit Rating Scales-Adapted & Extended to Excellence (HOVRS A+: Roggman et al. 2012) to assess home visit characteristics and quality. The HVOF-R facilitates simultaneous coding of data in three broad categories, with each category further divided into mutually exclusive subcategories: (1) primary interaction partners (e.g., parent–home visitor, parent–child, home visitor–child, joint home visitor–parent–child), (2) content of interaction (e.g., child’s development, parenting issues), and (3) nature of the interventionist’s interaction (e.g., observing, modeling, coaching, providing information, paperwork). Each category is coded simultaneously during 30-s observation intervals allowing for description of who was interacting with whom, the content of the interaction, and the home visitor’s specific role in the interaction during each interval (see Peterson et al. 2007 for complete description of the HVOF-R).For the current study, items were selected, conceptually, to represent triadic interactions. Intervals were identified as triadic interactions if primary interaction partners was coded as joint home visitor–parent–child and nature of the home interventionist’s interaction was coded as observing, modeling or coaching. Overall percentages of time spent in triadic interactions were calculated for each home visit.Each observer established inter-observer agreement at or > 85% overall with no single category < 80% on three consecutive observations before beginning independent data collection. Team members met weekly to discuss disagreements and code, by consensus, to ensure reliability of the data. The detailed nature of the HVOF-R interval coding system makes training observers time-consuming; consensus coding was used to train new observers, re-train observers if an observation fell below expected levels of agreement, and to clarify code definitions when necessary. Consensus coding was used for 56 observations, and the remaining 52 observations were coded independently with 16 coded by two independent observers. Across all categories, average interrater agreement was 89% with rates for each category as follows: primary interaction partners (94%), interaction content (88%), and nature of the interventionist’s interaction (85%).The HOVRS A+ facilitates quality ratings of home visit practices and engagement. Scores from four domains (home visitor responsiveness to family, home visitor relationship with family, home visitor facilitation of parent–child interaction, and home visitor non-intrusive collaboration) are averaged to provide a quality rating for home visit practices which captures the ways home visitors facilitate meaningful interactions between caregivers and children that promote developmental parenting behaviors. Scores from three domains (parent–child interaction, parent engagement, and child engagement) are averaged to provide a quality rating of overall engagement in home visit activities. An observer watches an entire home visit and then rates each of the seven domains from 1 (poor quality) to 7 (excellent quality) based on presence of a continuum of domain-specific behavioral indicators.Interrater agreement, based on developer criteria of 85% of items within one point within each domain, across three consecutive observations was achieved before an observer coded independently. Every fourth observation was coded by two observers to monitor interrater agreement. Average interrater agreement rates for each domain were: home visitor responsiveness to family (100%), home visitor relationship with family (97%), home visitor facilitation of parent–child interaction (100%), home visitor non-intrusive collaboration (90%), parent–child interaction (100%), parent engagement (100%), and child engagement (100%).Data AnalysesData captured with the HVOF-R were used to answer the first two research questions. Data from all 108 home visits were merged to calculate the overall proportion of home visit time spent in triadic interactions, as well as the proportions of time during triadic interactions that home visitors spent observing, modeling and coaching.For the third research question, proportions of time home visitors spent in these specific activities were examined in relation to home visit quality as measured by the HOVRS A+. Multilevel regression modeling controlled for the nesting of individual family home visits among the home visitors. Length of home visit was included in order to control for opportunity (time) home visitors had to engage in observation, modeling and coaching. ResultsPreliminary analyses revealed that home visit length ranged from 20 to 90 min (M = 46, SD = 16.04). Substantive results are presented below.Time Spent in Triadic Interactions and Home Visitors’ StrategiesFirst, interaction patterns were examined across all home visits (see Fig. 1). Home visitors spent almost three-quarters of their time interacting with the parent/s, with only 17% of the time spent in triadic interactions, the focus of this study. Given a mean home visit length of 46 min, on average, < 10 min of each visit was devoted to triadic interactions.Open in a separate windowFig. 1Proportion of home visit time by interaction partners and home visitor activity Examination of home visitors’ activities during triadic interactions revealed only 2% of each visit, on average, was spent coaching parent–child interactions. The remaining 15% of time spent in triadic interactions was divided evenly between home visitors observing parent–child interactions (8%) and modeling interaction for the parent (7%).Relating Home Visit Activities to Quality RatingsNext, we examined how home visitors’ time spent in triadic interactions was related to home visit quality. Table 2 presents data to describe home visit activities and quality, as well as correlations among home visit length; proportion of triadic interaction time the home visitor spent observing, modeling and coaching (from the HVOF-R); and quality ratings of home visit practices and engagement (from the HOVRS A+). Length of home visit was related only to home visit practices quality. Proportions of time the home visitor spent observing, modeling and coaching during triadic interactions were related to quality ratings of both home visit practices and engagement with one exception—observing was not related to the quality of home visit practies.Table 2Mean, standard deviations, and intercorrelations for quality scores and home visit interactions (N = 108)Measure M  SD 12345671.

This strategy was selected because approximately half the home visitors conducted visits with multiple families, and the interclass correlations indicated a nesting effect within home visitor for quality ratings of home visit practices (r = .30) and engagement (r = .13). Therefore, Level 1 variables included: (1) length of visit (control) and percentage of time the home visitor spent (2) observing, (3) modeling, and (4) coaching. Home visitor was included as a Level 2 variable.The proportion of time home visitors spent coaching predicted quality ratings of home visit practices after accounting for length of visit and proportions of time spent observing and modeling as presented on Table 3. Proportions of time spent observing and modeling did not predict quality ratings of home visit practices. Time spent observing, modeling and coaching each uniquely predicted quality ratings of engagement.Table 3Multilevel model predicting quality of home visit practices and engagement (Nvisit = 108, Nhomevisitor = 45)HOVRS A+ quality of home visit practicesHOVRS A+ quality of engagement b  p  SE 95% CI b  p  SE 95% CIObserving.00ns.01.03***.01Modeling.01ns.01.03**.01Coaching.08**.03.09**.03Length of visit.01*.00.00ns.01Random effects Residual variance.41.08.28–.61.60.11.42–.85Home visitor random effects.03.07− .00 to 3.80.07.09.01–.82Open in a separate window*p ≤ .05; **p ≤ .01; p ≤ .001  DiscussionThe theory of change guiding most home visiting programs that target families with risks, identifies the parent–child relationship and interactions as the primary mechanism for improving child development outcomes. Enhancing parent–child interactions is the stated focus of multiple model programs (e.g., EHS, HFA, PAT), and researchers have demonstrated that improving these interactions is related positively to later child development outcomes (Raikes et al. 2014). Parent engagement and a focus on child development content, important quality indicators for home visits (Korfmacher et al. 2008; Roggman et al. 2001), are related to more positive child and family outcomes in the short term (Raikes et al. 2006), as well as over time (Peterson et al. 2012).We examined use of triadic interactions, captured with the HVOF, to identify specific strategies, namely observing interactions, modeling for the parent and coaching the parent during parent–child interactions, home visitors use that relate positively to quality ratings of home visit practices and engagement captured with the HOVRS-A+. Very little time during the observed home visits, unfortunately, included simultaneously engaging the caregiver and child in home visit activities, similar to findings from earlier research (Peterson et al. 2007). The majority (71%) of home visit time spent in home visitor–parent interactions suggests a priority on engaging parents in discussions of child and family issues rather than supporting parent–child interactions directly. Even more striking is that of the average 17% of home visit time spent in triadic interactions, the vast majority of that time (15%) was spent either observing interactions or modeling for the parent rather than directly coaching parent–child interactions.Data from the current observations document that all triadic intervention strategies home visitors used (observing, modeling, and coaching) engage parents and children as evidenced by their relation to quality ratings of engagement. However, coaching parent–child interactions predicts quality ratings of home visit practices even after controlling for time spent observing and modeling. Coaching facilitates parent–child interactions and promotes collaboration when parents and home visitors work together to identify play activities and/or daily routines they would like to improve. While coaching, home visitors provide the context for a variety of high quality practices that enhance parent–child interactions targeted by most home visiting programs. Coaching parent–child interactions was associated with higher rates of maternal engagement during home visits, especially among parents facing significant risks (e.g., teenagers, low levels of education; Peterson et al. 2007). Despite low frequency, the significant relationship between coaching and quality ratings of home visit practices suggests that active coaching may be a particularly powerful mechanism for enhancing overall home visit quality and ultimately child outcomes.It is important to note that home visit length was related to quality ratings of home visit practices but not quality ratings of engagement. Bivariate correlations revealed that neither engaging in triadic interactions or family engagement is related systematically to length of visit alone. Together, this suggests that asking home visitors to devote significant portions of each visit to building rapport in order to engage family members is unlikely to be an effective strategy. As well, triadic interactions appear to be the necessary but not sufficient floor for engaging parents in meaningful interactions with their children. Facilitating effective parent–child interactions that can provide opportunities for home visitors to build parents’ competence through coaching takes not only time but sophisticated skills that allow home visitors to recognize interaction opportunities and capitalize on them. This unique relationship between coaching activity and quality ratings of home visit practices presents several important implications for professional development, but study limitations will be discussed first.LimitationsThe current study used data about individual home visits from a subset of families who participated in evaluation of Iowa’s MIECHV programs. While there were few differences between families participating in the evaluation and all families enrolled in the home visiting programs, the sample was limited in size and only includes home visits conducted in English. It is possible that home visits observed for this study may not be representative of the home visitors’ overall practices or all families’ experiences.Only one visit per family was observed. Ongoing examination of the HVOF-R has demonstrated that observing for 40–60 min provides a stable estimate of overall home visit activities for an individual family (Peterson et al., under review). Limited and inconsistent numbers of observations by home visitors made it impractical to examine practice differences within home visitor (across families). Finally, the majority of visits observed were from the HFA home visit model. This is representative of overall MIECHV services across the state, and the HFA model is used widely across the country. However, further examination of similarities and differences in home visitors’ activities across evidence-based models is needed for a more thorough understanding of the most important intervention elements of each model.ImplicationsThe primary practice implication of the current study is the need to increase the proportion of home visit time spent in triadic interactions. Relations between use of triadic interactions and quality ratings presented here align with other evidence emerging to support this practice. First, HOVRS-A+ quality ratings, which are higher when greater proportions of home visit time are devoted to triadic interactions, predict positive outcomes for both parents and children participating in home visiting programs (Roggman et al., under review). Positive communication outcomes among toddlers with disabilities resulted from interventionists coaching interactions while engaging the parent and child in triadic interactions (Brown and Woods 2015).While positive relations between use of triadic interaction strategies and ratings of effectiveness quality is not surprising given the operational definitions used in each code, data presented here help identify interaction patterns and specific behaviors home visitors can implement to maximize program efficacy. Triadic interactions set the stage for enhancing parent–child interactions, strengthening parent–child relationships, and building parenting efficacy. Families are very diverse and strengthening the skills of multiple caregivers to interact effectively with young children may be important in many families. For example, purposeful inclusion of father figures in home visit activities may be particularly effective in promoting child development outcomes across domains (Cabrera et al. 2007). Rowe (2018) found father figures present in the home during approximately 25% of visits. When fathers were present, they were available for interaction over 75% of the time, on average, but were included by the home visitor only 43% of the time indicating a need to provide home visitors further professional development in this area.Increasing the amount of time spent in triadic interactions will necessarily mean decreasing the amount of time spent in other types of interactions, especially time spent in parent–home visitor interactions. Parent–home visitor interactions are necessary for sharing information about the program, as well as information about community resources and educational opportunities. Likely, some parent–home visitor interaction time is needed to ensure open communication and a trusting relationship, but if optimizing child outcomes and enhancing parent–child relationships continue to be a primary target for home visiting programs, home visitor–parent interactions should not be to the exclusion of coaching parent–child interactions directly. In short, home visits need to reflect more action and less talking, but this is much easier to say than do.Many home visitors will need support to increase use of triadic interactions, and more specifically coaching, which should be a central focus of professional development for home visitors and continuous improvement activities for programs. Effective home visiting involves a complex set of interactions and contexts. Likely, short-term focus on one specific behavior will not be effective; rather attention to knowledge, skills, and attitudes home visitors need to build relationships with families facing risks while helping them build competencies will be needed (Roggman et al. 2016). Home visitors must have knowledge not only about child development, but also about family systems, families’ beliefs and cultural practices, and challenges faced by families living in poverty. Home visitors need skills to engage families in relationships focused on supporting their children, help parents build knowledge and skills, and enhance parent–child interactions. Finally, home visitors need attitudes that recognize parents’ expertise on their own children, accept flexibility, and promote self-reflection. Roggman and colleagues (2016) provide recommendations for higher education providers, but some of the same recommendations could guide professional development efforts for current home visitors and their agency colleagues.Recently, programs have begun to experiment with virtual home visiting. Virtual home visits depend on a unique form of triadic interactions; while the home visitor is not in physical proximity to the parent and child, joint interaction among the participants is key to engagement and communication. Home visitors actually coach parent–child interactions more during virtual home visits as compared to in-person visits; likely, the home visitor’s lack of direct physical contact with the child necessitates working through the parent to engage the child, the essence of coaching parent–child interactions (Behl et al. 2017). Lessons learned from these programs may give valuable information about how to train and support both home visitors and their supervisors around increasing the use of coaching strategies.Close examination of overall agency functioning, how supervisors work with home visitors, and how program administrators arrange training and support is needed as well. High quality infrastructure supports for home visiting programs is related to higher quality home visits (Korfmacher et al., under review) and is evidenced by more thorough supports for direct service providers. For example, direct observations, either in real time or through video recording, can provide essential information for reflective supervision that can maximize the valuable time resources of home visitation. Decreasing the amount of home visit time devoted to paperwork and other administrative tasks may also be fruitful. This may call for examining overall reporting requirements, as well as efficiency for meeting those requirements.Home visiting programs are administered by a variety of social services, health, and education agencies, all of which have demonstrated efficacy in a variety of locations. Fortunately, most home visiting programs serving families with young children share relationship-based collaborative elements that can be observed, measured and supported to help guide professional development efforts. While no specific “administrative home” may be necessary to ensure program effectiveness, attention to supervisory and professional development supports necessary to achieve and sustain high quality services will be key and may require oversight from local, state, and federal policy makers and funders.",significancewhat alreadi known topic   home visit program support parent practic famili face

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/33210336/,"AbstractBackgroundThe disease burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is not uniform across occupations. Although healthcare workers are well‐known to be at increased risk, data for other occupations are lacking. In lieu of this, models have been used to forecast occupational risk using various predictors, but no model heretofore has used data from actual case numbers. This study assesses the differential risk of COVID‐19 by occupation using predictors from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) database and correlating them with case counts published by the Washington State Department of Health to identify workers in individual occupations at highest risk of COVID‐19 infection.MethodsThe O*NET database was screened for potential predictors of differential COVID‐19 risk by occupation. Case counts delineated by occupational group were obtained from public sources. Prevalence by occupation was estimated and correlated with O*NET data to build a regression model to predict individual occupations at greatest risk.ResultsTwo variables correlate with case prevalence: disease exposure (r = 0.66; p = 0.001) and physical proximity (r = 0.64; p = 0.002), and predict 47.5% of prevalence variance (p = 0.003) on multiple linear regression analysis. The highest risk occupations are in healthcare, particularly dental, but many nonhealthcare occupations are also vulnerable.ConclusionsModels can be used to identify workers vulnerable to COVID‐19, but predictions are tempered by methodological limitations. Comprehensive data across many states must be collected to adequately guide implementation of occupation‐specific interventions in the battle against COVID‐19.Keywords: COVID‐19, infection control, occupational medicine, preventive medicine, workplace safety AbbreviationsBLS U.S.Bureau of Labor StatisticsCDCCenters for Disease Control and PreventionCIconfidence intervalCOVID‐19coronavirus disease 2019HCWhealthcare workerO*NETOccupational Information NetworkPRprevalence ratioSOCStandard Occupational Classification 1. INTRODUCTIONThe global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic continues to have profound and devastating effects world‐wide. As of this writing (August 2020), there have been over five million infections caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus and over 170,000 deaths in the United States alone. 1  Both on the individual and societal levels, no dimension of modern life has been spared from the impact of COVID‐19 and the measures implemented in the fight against its spread. 2  As in other pandemics, the burden of disease is not uniform across subpopulations. 3  Workers bear a particular risk of exposure during these times. Staying at home has been shown to reduce infection rates, 4  but despite the efforts of numerous industries to transition their employees to remote work, those employed in many essential occupations do not enjoy this luxury. 5  This creates a differential risk of exposure by occupation. Although it is well known that frontline healthcare workers (HCW) are at increased risk “due to close personal exposure to patients with the virus,” 6  data for other professions, particularly in nonhealthcare industries, are sparse. In the United States, the only published statistics detailing COVID‐19 infections by occupation was released in June 2020 and updated in July by the Washington State Department of Health. 7  Due to this paucity of actual data, statistical models have been used to forecast the risk of contracting COVID‐19 by occupation using various predictors. A widely cited article in the New York Times 8  identified two factors that may increase this risk: the general risk of disease exposure on the job and the physical proximity of workers to others. The author used corresponding datasets from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) provided by the US Department of Labor, an established method of risk assessment in the occupational medicine literature. 9  Consisting of “detailed occupational information on over 900 jobs… O*NET provides estimates for workers' exposure to a number of physical hazards and adverse working conditions.” 10  However, no research has correlated these factors to actual data on COVID‐19 infections. The aim of this study is to identify possible predictors in the O*NET database that differ by occupation using real case numbers and to use these predictors recursively on O*NET data to forecast specific occupations at highest risk. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1. Dataset selectionThe present study is a retrospective analysis of preexisting occupational data to determine the differential risk of COVID‐19 by profession. A recently released reported from the Washington State Department of Health detailing the absolute number of infections by major occupational group was used. 7  This report provides data on 26,799 laboratory confirmed cases of COVID‐19 amongst Washington State residents up until June 16th 2020. Those cases with occupational data available (41% of the total, or 10,850) were delineated into the 22 nonmilitary major occupational groups, as defined by the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). 11  These data were then used for this present analysis to estimate the corresponding prevalence by comparison to the most recent BLS state occupational employment figures from May 2019. 12  These estimates were then compared to occupational data from O*NET. The O*NET database contains “hundreds of standardized and occupation‐specific descriptors on almost 1000 occupations covering the entire US economy.” 13  Data is continuously collected through worker surveys, and each descriptor is assessed with a question whose response is converted from an ordinal to a ratio scale. For example, the assessment of the descriptor “Disease Exposure” uses the question, “How often does this job require exposure to disease/infections?,” with possible answers ranging from “never” to “every day.” 14  These responses are converted to a scale between 0 and 100 for each individual occupation. Data from the category of Work Context, which encompasses the data descriptors “Interpersonal Relationships,” “Physical Work Conditions,” and “Structural Job Characteristics” were retrieved. Altogether, these categories contain 57 individual “physical and social factors that influence the nature of work.” 15  Because data from each factor is provided for over 900 individual jobs, the arithmetic average was calculated for the jobs in each of the 22 major occupational groups to obtain the factor mean by group. For example, each factor for the individual 32 occupations under the “Personal Care and Service” major occupational group was averaged together to obtain a group factor. This was spread over the 57 individual factors to derive 1254 individual data points. Weighted averages by employment numbers were not used due to differences in the reporting of SOC classifications between BLS and O*NET datasets. Ethical approval was not required for this research because all data is assessed from publicly available sources.2.2. Statistical modelingThe 57 individual factors were examined, and variables most likely to influence rates of COVID‐19 infection were selected based on biological plausibility. A bivariate correlation matrix was used on all factors to identify the most likely predictors to be included in regression analysis. Outliers were assessed with Cook's distance, and values greater than three times the mean distance were considered for removal. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to observe the impact of remaining covariates on the prevalence of COVID‐19 cases by occupational group, with correlation and determination coefficients reported. Standardized (β) and unstandardized (B) regression coefficients are provided with 95% confidence intervals for the latter. Statistical significance was set at α = 0.05. All statistical testing was conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 24 for Windows (SPSS Inc).2.3. Assessment of high‐risk occupationsThe resulting regression equation was applied to O*NET data by individual occupation to predict specific occupations with workers at highest risk of contracting COVID‐19. Both healthcare (SOC codes beginning with 29 or 31) and nonhealthcare occupations (all other codes) were assessed. Because the absolute number of cases will always increase across all occupations, we provided predicted prevalence ratios (PR) as a measure of relative risk amongst different occupations. These ratios, along with confidence intervals for predicted values, were estimated using the formula: PPRi=PPiPC−PCiE−Eiwhere, for any occupation i, PPR i is the predicted PR, PP i is the predicted prevalence, PC i is the predicted total number of COVID‐19 cases in that occupation in the United States, and E i is the total number of workers employed in that occupation in the United States. PC is the predicted total number of COVID‐19 cases across all occupations, and E is the total number of workers employed in the United States. National employment statistics from the BLS with employment figures by individual occupation for the entire United States were used for these estimations. 16  Occupations were included only if there is corresponding employment data. 3. RESULTS3.1. Case counts and prevalence by occupational groupBased on statistics from the Washington State Department of Health, there were 10,850 cases of COVID‐19 in Washington State tabulated by profession (Table 1). Using employment figures from the BLS, the estimated prevalence of cases ranged from 63.8 workers in the computer and mathematical occupations to 3330.3 workers in the farming, fishing, and forestry occupations per 100,000 workers employed.Table 1Count and prevalence of COVID‐19 cases by major occupational groupMajor occupational groupCase countNumber employed in WashingtonEstimated cases/employed × 100,000Architecture and engineering9777,020125.9Arts, design, entertainment, sports, and media9349,860186.5Building and grounds cleaning and maintenance57990,590639.1Business and financial operations203225,94089.8Community and social service17852,280340.5Computer and mathematical111173,94063.8Construction and extraction606169,600357.3Education, training, and library241189,670127.1Farming, fishing, and forestry74122,2503330.3Food preparation and serving related517299,950172.4Healthcare practitioners and technical1208171,440704.6Healthcare support989144,170686Installation, maintenance, and repair240133,320180Legal4922,500217.8Life, physical, and social science5439,850135.5Management667162,850409.6Office and administrative support695392,860176.9Personal care and service57974,900773Production964178,980538.6Protective service23166,690346.4Sales and related712316,510225Transportation and material moving1096263,330416.2Open in a separate windowAbbreviation: COVID‐19, coronavirus disease 2019.This article is being made freely available through PubMed Central as part of the COVID-19 public health emergency response.

Multiple regression analysisA correlation matrix (Supporting Information File) demonstrated that only the O*NET predictors of disease exposure (Pearson's r = 0.66; p = 0.001) and physical proximity (r = 0.64; p = 0.002) were associated with case prevalence by occupation. The occupational group “Farming, Fishing, and Forestry” was excluded from subsequent analysis due to its extreme Cook's distance of 1.4, far exceeding three times the mean distance of 0.07. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that altogether, disease exposure and physical proximity predicted 47.5% of prevalence variance (p = 0.003). However, these covariates are highly collinear (r = 0.78; p < 0.0001) and alone are not independent contributors to the regression model (β = 0.4; p = 0.16 for disease exposure, β = 0.33; p = 0.25 for proximity; Table 4).Table 4Results of multiple linear regression analysis of disease exposure and physical proximity on case prevalence β  B 95% CI lower95% CI upper F value R 2  p Model8.140.475 0.003 Disease exposure0.44.03−1.799.850.16Physical proximity0.336.32−4.7517.390.25Open in a separate window Note: Bold value provide statistically significant.Abbreviation: CI, confidence interval.This article is being made freely available through PubMed Central as part of the COVID-19 public health emergency response.

Prediction of occupations with highest COVID‐19 riskThe resulting linear regression model was applied to every individual SOC on O*NET for which there exists corresponding employment data with the BLS to predict the specific professions at highest risk of COVID‐19. The 15 occupations which overall have the highest predicted risk are all healthcare professions, with four of the top five in the dental health field (Table 5).

Furthermore, this model was used recursively on individual SOC classifications to estimate the specific occupations at highest risk.Although this study is based upon case numbers from only a single state, extrapolation to the whole of the United States yields predicted case counts that are in line with actual estimates. COVID‐19 cases with employment data are provided for Washington State up to June 16th 2020, at which time there were around 1.68 million cases in the United States. 22  Applying the regression model to the entire working population of 147 million in the US results in a total predicted case count of 484,000 workers, a very close figure considering that counts from Washington contained occupational data from only 41% of cases, and the employment to population ratio is generally 50%–60%. 23  Nevertheless, it is important to note that predicted case numbers are not so relevant as relative figures. Not only are case counts underestimated due to incomplete data, but, cumulative total case counts will always increase over time. Therefore, occupational risk is better captured through predicted PR rather than absolute predicted prevalence.It is not surprising that HCWs, especially those at the frontline in the battle against COVID‐19, are at the highest risk. 6  After all, both the general risk of disease exposure and physical proximity are higher in this group than in any other, and any model which uses these factors as risk predictors will be dominated by HCWs. Even within HCWs, however, there are some workers which are predicted to be particularly at risk. Of note, fully half of the predicted riskiest occupations are in the dental field, which faces unique challenges during this pandemic. Although data on COVID‐19 cases are not available, it is clear that “the unique nature of dental interventions, which include aerosol generation, handling of sharps, and proximity of the provider to the patient's oropharyngeal region” 24  exposes dentists and oral health professionals to infection. 25  “The risk is considered to be higher in dental practices than in other healthcare settings,” 26  and as neither social distancing nor remote work is possible, dental professionals must take special precautions to avoid infection, 27  and some have elected to close their offices altogether. 28  Nonhealthcare occupations at the highest risk of COVID‐19 infection are dominated by workers who are either in close direct contact with others, such as flight attendants, teachers, barbers, jailers, and transportation security screeners, or may be directly exposed to SARS‐CoV‐2 (ambulance drivers, morticians, embalmers). Other than teachers, none of these workers have the option of working remotely, and specific on‐the‐job interventions are required to protect these workers.The differential risk of occupational COVID‐19 also leads to differential economic outcomes for those especially at risk. New cases are associated with continued negative effects on the labor market, 29  and given the intimate interconnection between physical health and economic health, 30  the contributions of the latter to both individual and societal well‐being must not be understated. Indeed, much research, particularly in the labor economics literature, have employed a similar approach using O*NET or similar data to explore the relationship between occupational characteristics and economic outcomes to create models of economic disparities by occupation or industry. One early study used differential telework ability and essential worker distribution to identify negative labor shocks by occupation, 31  while another examined the same outcome using physical proximity predictors from O*NET. 32  Other studies have used O*NET data to create indices reflecting the ease of remote work, and concluded that the economic burden of COVID‐19 falls disproportionately on low income workers, 33 ,  34  women, and workers with low educational attainment. 35  These economic outcomes represent variable social determinants of health that are crucial in understanding the differential impact of COVID‐19 on individuals and populations 36  and may lend support to social insurance as a means to reduce hardship in particularly vulnerable workers. 37  There are numerous limitations to the present research, particularly on the dataset level. Potential limitations of O*NET data have previously been discussed, particularly misclassification, undercounting, failure to account for exposure variation within occupations, and bias due to the subjective nature of the questionnaires. 19  From a COVID‐19 specific standpoint, O*NET data cannot be expected to reflect more recent changes in the working environment as a consequence of the pandemic. These changes can be intentional, in the form of measures aimed specifically to reduce exposure risk, or unintentional, due to social or economic fallout. For example, the predictor of physical proximity does not adequately capture the practice of social distancing or the push to work from home in many industries. Meanwhile, it is possible that the risk to transportation workers might be less than predicted due to reduced overall travel demand.The use of only two O*NET variables, physical proximity and disease exposure, does not adequately represent the myriad of other factors that might affect occupational risk. For example, recent research has suggested that race and ethnicity may influence differential risk amongst occupations, but individual O*NET predictors are not further delineated by these factors. Only by calculating the percentage of essential workers by race employed in occupations at high risk could the influence of these factors be detected. 20  This may explain the highly anomalous case count in the farming, fishing, and forestry major occupational group. Although comprising only 3% of employed workers in Washington, this group represents 11% of all COVID‐19 cases, a greater overrepresentation than even healthcare providers, and was excluded from this regression analysis. On closer inspection, it can be noted that this group accounts for a staggering 14% of the cases amongst Hispanics, and only less than 1%, 2%, and 2% amongst non‐Hispanic Whites, Asians, and Blacks, respectively, yet this figure is tempered by noting that 14% of the Hispanic population in Washington is employed in that occupation. Differential occupational placement by ethnicity clearly influences case numbers, but O*NET predictors fail to take this into account.In addition, there are significant limitations with the Washington State data. As noted previously, only 41% of COVID‐19 cases in Washington contained occupational information, although this figure was 57% for those between the ages of 18–64. However, “in 2019, an estimated 73% of the population [in this age range] were employed.” 7  The reason for this discrepancy is not known, and raises the possibility of group differences, not only between all cases with employment data and all cases without, but also between the former and the cases who should have been recently employed but did not provide data. Furthermore, because all state data is provided as static aggregate sums reflecting cases from inception until June 2020 without further delineation into discrete time periods, it is not possible to track changes in case trends that might reflect changing practices in the workplace in response to the pandemic. However, any further temporal analysis must also take into account overall community transmission levels.Due to these and other limitations, more extensive case data tabulated by occupation are needed to fully understand the impact of COVID‐19 on the working population. Industry specific recommendations to guide mitigation efforts are currently available from federal 38  and state 39  agencies, including Washington. 40  These address settings where workers are at particularly high risk, including healthcare facilities, 41  dental offices, 42  restaurants, 43  and beauty salons. 44  However, any recommendations or policy changes considered will benefit from more accurate occupational data. Although the case count of HCWs is actively updated, 45  data for other occupations are lacking, and even HCW data is not delineated by individual occupation. As noted by the CDC, “without good surveillance data on the jobs of all workers with COVID‐19, it's hard to tell what groups are at higher risk because of their jobs.” 46  Collecting data on occupation and workplace, if employed, is now recommended as part of risk assessment during COVID‐19 case interviews. 47  These initiatives should yield improved data on the occupational risk of COVID‐19 and should guide the implementation of occupation‐specific interventions aimed at reducing this risk. The health and safety of millions of workers are at stake. 5. CONCLUSIONOccupational risk of COVID‐19 infection is not uniform across occupational groups. Physical proximity and general disease exposure are risk factors, but do not fully capture the extent of differential risk across occupations. Recent measures such as social distancing and remote working may not be reflected in these predictors, and not all measures are equally applicable to every occupation. HCWs, particularly those in the front lines and in the dental professions, remain at particular risk. More comprehensive data is needed on the individual occupation level, preferably across the entire United States, to fully assess worker risk and direct protective measures tailored to individual occupations.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/29852022/,"IntroductionToday, humans are the only hominin species walking the planet. This exclusivity is a recent feature of our species’ history. Specifically, though anatomically modern humans first appear in the archaeological record 200–300 kya [1–4], other hominins persisted until as recently as 30–40 kya [5,6]. In some cases, modern humans overlapped temporally and spatially with archaic humans (for example, Neanderthals and Denisovans and perhaps others [7,8]). Neanderthals left a rich archaeological and paleontological record and resided in the Middle East, Europe, and parts of Asia [9–11]. Denisovans, whom we only know about from ancient DNA taken from a single finger bone and three teeth [12–14], are believed to have resided in parts of East and Southeast Asia.There has been long-standing interest in whether anatomically modern humans and archaic human ancestors hybridized. Historically, attempts at answering this question focused on archaeological remains and compared dental, cranial, and postcranial features from modern human and archaic human sites for evidence of hybrid morphologies [15]. By the early 2000s, technological innovations enabled the extraction and sequencing of mitochondrial DNA from archaic human remains [16–19] and eventually facilitated the capture and sequencing of the full nuclear genome [20–22].The complete sequencing of archaic and modern human nuclear genomes led to the discovery that modern non-African human populations shared more genetic ancestry with archaic humans than did African populations [22]. Initial inferences demonstrated a strong likelihood of hybridization between archaic humans and the ancestors of all modern non-African populations, and these results proved robust to alternative explanations, such as archaic population structure. The continued development of ancient DNA technology facilitated extraction and sequencing of high-quality Neanderthal [23] and Denisovan [13] reference genomes. These foundational resources, coupled with advances in statistical and computational tools for analyzing ancient genomes, enabled the identification of sequences inherited from archaic ancestors (i.e., introgressed sequences) in the genomes of modern human individuals.Considerable progress has been made in the study of archaic–hominin admixture, which has been reviewed elsewhere [24–28]. However, many outstanding questions remain, the resolution of which are critical to more completely understand the history and consequences of admixture between archaic and modern humans. In this review, we discuss several of these questions, including refining models of admixture history, determining the mechanisms responsible for the loss and retention of archaic sequence, and describing the functional implications of surviving Neanderthal sequence in the modern human genome. How high was the initial level of archaic–modern human admixture?All modern non-African genomes are estimated to carry approximately 2%–7% archaic human sequence: approximately 2% ancestry from Neanderthals and an additional 2%–5% ancestry from Denisovans in Melanesian populations [29–31]. However, present-day levels of archaic ancestry need not reflect initial admixture levels, which is of special interest in understanding human history. Specifically, an accurate estimate of initial admixture levels would provide significant insights into models of hybridization and admixture dynamics.Following the discovery of approximately 2% Neanderthal ancestry in modern non-Africans [22], it was estimated the initial level of admixture between Neanderthals and modern humans was also 2% [32–34]. However, further analyses revealed large depletions of Neanderthal ancestry across the human genome, suggesting widespread purging of deleterious Neanderthal sequence. For example, in the 20% of the genome with the lowest density of functionally important elements, Neanderthal ancestry is 1.54× the genome-wide average [34]. Assuming this subset of the genome to be unaffected by selection, the implication is that the initial proportion of Neanderthal ancestry after admixture was >3%.Several recent analyses have estimated the initial Neanderthal admixture proportion was dramatically higher than 3% [35,36]. These studies propose the prolonged small effective population size of Neanderthals led to a high frequency of weakly deleterious alleles in the Neanderthal population [35,36]. When these Neanderthal alleles entered the human population, with a comparatively larger effective population size, they were more readily removed by selection. Using simulations and models reflecting this expectation, these studies estimate the initial admixture proportion to have been 2×–5× the level present in modern human genomes.Analyses of additional ancient DNA samples support the hypothesis that initial admixture levels were much higher than those found today. Genome-wide data from Eurasian samples ranging in age from 45–7 kya suggest an initial Neanderthal admixture proportion close to 6%, which decreased gradually over time to a contemporary level of 2% [37]. Because all the individuals analyzed descended from a single founding population, the authors argue the steady decline in Neanderthal ancestry is driven by natural selection against introgressed sequence and not dilution from a nonadmixed population. Consistent with this hypothesis is the discovery of an ancient East Asian individual, dated to 40 kya, who was an ancestor of modern Asians and who carried 4%–5% Neanderthal ancestry [38]. Additionally, sequence data from a 42 kya anatomically modern human from Pęstera cu Oase, Romania, reveal this individual shared 6%–9% of his genome with Neanderthals, more than 3× any contemporary modern humans [39]. However, it is important to note that the Pęstera cu Oase individual had a very recent Neanderthal ancestor (within 4–6 generations) and likely did not contribute any ancestry to modern populations.If the initial proportion of Neanderthal ancestry was indeed higher, it raises additional questions about the rate at which Neanderthal sequence was lost. Though analysis of ancient samples projects a gradual and linear reduction in Neanderthal ancestry from 45 kya to the present [37], simulations involving high frequency and weakly deleterious alleles indicate a process featuring an initial rapid loss of Neanderthal sequence followed by a more gradual loss [35]. Answering questions regarding the initial admixture level, the duration of admixture, and the rate of archaic-sequence loss will depend on the continued collection of ancient human and Neanderthal samples closer to the time of admixture. To date, no estimates have been provided for initial levels of Denisovan admixture, in part because of the paucity of data and the uncertainty regarding where and when admixture could have occurred. How many distinct pulses of admixture occurred with Neanderthals?Closely related to the question of how high initial levels of admixture were, the number of independent admixture events (sometimes referred to as “pulses” in the literature) is also uncertain. Initially, this question seemed to have a simple answer—admixture with Neanderthals occurred once in human history. Early studies found that all non-Africans carried approximately equal levels of Neanderthal ancestry [22]. Therefore, the most parsimonious model involved a single pulse of admixture between Neanderthals and an Out-Of-Africa wave of human migrants, before the ancestral Eurasian population split into European and Asian lineages (Fig 1).Open in a separate windowFig 1A simplified model of admixture history between archaic and anatomically modern human populations.There is consensus that at least two independent gene-flow events occurred (solid arrows)—admixture from Neanderthals into an ancestral Eurasian population (solid blue) and from Denisovans into an ancestral Southeast Asia population (solid red). It is likely that additional instances of admixture occurred, explaining the variation in the percentage of archaic sequence across different global populations. These additional instances include a pulse of admixture from Neanderthals (dashed blue) and from Denisovans (dashed red) into an ancestral East Asian population. Alternatively, or in addition, global variation in archaic ancestry could be the result of admixture within human populations (dashed orange) diluting archaic sequence. Admixture from human populations may also have introduced sequence into archaic populations.However, as more globally diverse populations were analyzed with refined methods, they found that levels of Neanderthal ancestry varied among populations. Analyses of introgressed Neanderthal sequence using the high-quality Altai reference genome [23] noted more regions of Neanderthal origin in Asian and American populations than European ones [32], as well as higher levels of Neanderthal ancestry in East Asian populations compared to European populations and lower levels of Neanderthal ancestry in Melanesians compared to either East Asians or Europeans [30,31] (Fig 2A). The differences in these Neanderthal ancestry proportions are on the order of 0.1%–0.5%. How we interpret the global variation in archaic human ancestry has a profound impact on our understanding of human history, informing our estimate for the frequency of archaic–modern human admixture—either as isolated in time and space or recurrent and pervasive.Open in a separate windowFig 2Patterns and characteristics of archaic sequence across the genome.(A) A representation of individual genomes from archaic and modern human populations. The modern human genomes (orange) are ordered by increasing levels of Neanderthal (blue) admixture percentage (approximate). Only Asian populations carry Denisovan (red) sequence. Some introgressed archaic segments are shared across populations, and some large regions of the genome are deserted of introgressed archaic sequence in all populations examined. (B) Large deserts may be a product of selection against deleterious archaic variants (gold stars) at those loci. Whether selection acted against a few strongly deleterious variants (top) or many weakly deleterious variants (bottom) remains uncertain. (C) Many segments of introgressed archaic sequence are found to carry variants (stars) that affect gene regulation and expression. Altering gene expression may affect downstream protein levels (e.g., immunological proteins) and could have provided a mechanism of rapid adaptation for admixed modern humans. (D) Putatively adaptive introgressed segments can be identified by examining the frequency of introgressed segments (blue dots) within a population and filtering for those that exceed a percentile cutoff (dashed black line).Considering the variation in levels of Neanderthal ancestry among populations, a single pulse of admixture may still be the most parsimonious explanation. For example, admixture between ancient Europeans and populations lacking Neanderthal ancestry could have diluted the amount of Neanderthal ancestry remaining in modern European populations [13,40] (Fig 1). It has also been proposed that less-efficient purifying selection in East Asians due to a smaller effective population size led to the retention of more Neanderthal sequence [34].Alternatively, several analyses using statistical and simulation approaches suggest that models incorporating multiple pulses of admixture better explain the data [30,33,41–43]. These models include an initial wave of admixture into an ancestral non-African population, followed by additional admixture events into an ancestral Eurasian population and ancestral East Asian population [43] or just an ancestral Asian population [33] (Fig 1). Studies simulating admixture over a range of selection and demographic models can only account for the higher proportion of Neanderthal ancestry in East Asians compared to Europeans by including multiple pulses of admixture [42,44]. Even a “two-pulse” model may be too simplistic a representation for the history of human and Neanderthal admixture. Simulations that included additional admixture events, such as an intermediate admixture pulse into the ancestral population of Europeans and East Asians but not Southeast Asians, are also compatible with the empirical data for archaic ancestry in diverse populations [30]. It is important to note that the estimated number of admixture “pulses” is an oversimplification of real population history assumed for modeling, and compatible with a broad range of specific gene-flow models with varying intensities and duration. Was there a sex bias in gene flow?Sex biases—historical differences in sex ratios—are common in modern human populations, and several studies have shown them to vary across time using sequence data collected from the X chromosomes of geographically diverse populations [45–47]. Sex-biased hybridization has been invoked, along with other mechanisms, as an explanation for the reduced level of Neanderthal ancestry along the X chromosome—approximately one-fifth that of the autosomes [33,34]. Models of hybridization that specifically examined the X chromosome found the range of selection values against Neanderthal sequence varied for simulated Asian and European populations—possibly a result of differing effective population sizes—and that selection against Neanderthal sequence on the X chromosome was greater than on the autosomes [36]. The difference in the strength of selection against Neanderthal sequence on the X chromosome versus the autosomes may also be, in part, influenced by the hemizygosity of X chromosome genes in males.Alternatively, reduced Neanderthal ancestry on the X chromosome is also consistent with models that use a lower initial admixture proportion for the X chromosome, reflecting a bias towards more frequent Neanderthal male and human female pairings—potentially as great as 3× more frequent than the complementary pairing [36]. A bias towards Neanderthal male and human female pairings could also help explain why investigations of Neanderthal and human mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited maternally, show no indication of Neanderthal–human admixture [19,48]. Questions surrounding sex-biased hybridization—if it occurred, its direction and magnitude, and whether it varied among non-African populations with different admixture histories—could yield new insights into the cultural dynamics of archaic admixture. Furthermore, the above studies have focused on instances of Neanderthal gene flow into human populations, while the reciprocal situation—human gene flow into Neanderthal populations—may show a different sex bias because of biological mechanisms, cultural practices, or historical events. Who were the Denisovans?While there exists a wealth of archaeological data regarding the geographic distribution of Neanderthals, informing models of where and when admixture could have occurred, there is a paucity of corresponding data for the other known archaic human species—Denisovans. This leaves us with a limited ability to model where admixture occurred, into which populations, and how frequently. The fact that the only Denisovan remains were found in Siberia, while the population carrying the greatest Denisovan ancestry resides in Melanesia [12,49,50], suggests the process by which Denisovan DNA entered Asian populations was complex. Does the substantial distance between the Denisova Cave and Southeast Asia indicate that Denisovans inhabited such a large geographic range? If so, why do geographically intermediate populations in East Asia carry a substantially smaller proportion of Denisovan ancestry?Models aiming to explain the distribution of Denisovan ancestry have invoked either multiple pulses of admixture into separate East and Southeast Asian lineages, each undergoing unique demographic events [50], or dilution of Denisovan ancestry in East Asian lineages through admixture with populations lacking any Denisovan ancestry [51,52] (Fig 1).Discordance between the Denisovan and modern human divergence times estimated from mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA—1 million years ago versus 500,000 years ago, respectively—has been interpreted as evidence that Denisovans also interbred with another archaic hominin distinct from Neanderthals or humans [12,53]. Possible candidates for such interbreeding include Homo erectus and H. heidelbergensis, archaic human species that archaeological data suggest inhabited East and Southeast Asia as recently as 100 kya [54,55]. Might these archaic species have also interbred with anatomically modern humans? An accurate model of Denisovan and human admixture and a better understanding of Denisovans in general heavily depend on finding more Denisovan and other archaic human species remains. Did archaic hominin admixture happen in Africa?While the genetic evidence, collected from archaic and modern human DNA samples, persuasively demonstrates archaic hominin admixture in non-African populations, similar studies of archaic admixture in African populations have been limited. This is despite the fact that numerous archaic hominin lineages are known to have existed in Africa [56] and may have overlapped in time and space with modern humans [57]. Studies of archaic admixture in Africans have been hindered by the historical underrepresentation of African populations in large genomic datasets and the absence of reference genomes for archaic African hominins—the combined effects of the greater age of archaic samples and challenging climate impeding the recovery of ancient DNA.Several studies, however, have made a concerted effort to investigate the likelihood of archaic admixture in African populations, leveraging linkage-disequilibrium–based [58,59] and demographic-model–based [60] methods for detecting signals of archaic admixture without an archaic reference genome. Evidence from these early studies does indicate admixture occurred between an unidentified archaic hominin ancestor and several African populations and contributed functionally relevant genetic variation at specific loci, such as the salivary MUC7 locus [61]. In the absence of any recovered ancient DNA samples, “excavating” archaic sequences from modern African genomes may be the best strategy to identify archaic hominin lineages. Although studies of archaic admixture in Africa are limited and have been necessarily cautious in their conclusions, we anticipate significant new discoveries as more genomic data from diverse African populations become available. What caused deserts of archaic sequence to form?Compiling the surviving introgressed archaic human haplotypes in hundreds of individuals from geographically diverse populations led to a “map” of introgressed sequence across the human genome. While introgressed sequence tends to be widespread across the genome, covering all 22 autosomes and the 2 sex chromosomes, it was a striking discovery to find that there also exist large depletions—“deserts”—of archaic ancestry (Fig 2A).On the autosomes, the largest deserts span multiple megabases, with a handful extending up to 10 Mb in length [31,33]. The mechanisms responsible for the heterogeneous distribution of Neanderthal sequence across the autosomes are not yet fully understood, and several may act in combination. Understanding the processes responsible for this heterogeneous distribution could be informative about what distinguished modern and archaic humans.One proposed explanation for autosomal deserts is that they resulted from intense bottlenecks in the human population [34]. Theoretically, a bottleneck soon after admixture with Neanderthals could cause the rapid loss of large introgressed haplotypes, before they could be broken apart by generations of recombination. Simulations exploring some of these extreme demographic scenarios have found genetic drift able to explain some, but not all, of the observed data [30].Alternatively, selection against Neanderthal haplotypes at desert loci might also generate large depletions of archaic sequence. Selection against specific deleterious Neanderthal alleles in the admixed population could remove large swaths of linked archaic sequence. Deserts of introgressed sequence do exhibit higher levels of background selection and human–Neanderthal sequence divergence [30,33]. Furthermore, deserts of Neanderthal sequence overlap with deserts of Denisovan sequence significantly more often than expected by chance [30]. These data indicate the repeated loss of archaic DNA at specific loci across multiple independent admixture events.If selection played a part in the removal of large Neanderthal haplotypes and the formation of deserts, an obvious question is whether selection acted strongly on a very few sites or weakly across multiple sites (Fig 2B). Studies modeling the effective population sizes of Neanderthals and humans before and during admixture suggest that the small size of the Neanderthal population would have allowed weakly deleterious alleles to drift as if neutral and accumulate at a high frequency [35]. When these alleles entered the human population through admixture, the effective size of the human population need only have been marginally larger than the Neanderthal population to increase the strength of selection against these alleles and effect their removal. At the same time, deserts of introgression tend to exhibit higher levels of background selection and are also significantly enriched for genes expressed in the brain, such as FOXP2, which is essential to speech and language development [30,33,62]. These patterns suggest strong selection at a single locus could drive the loss of Neanderthal sequence across a wide region. Furthermore, environmental differences between modern and archaic humans may have meant that, rather than just the force of selection changing, the selection pressures themselves might have changed for archaic alleles when they entered the human population. What was potentially advantageous or neutral in a Neanderthal population may have been deleterious in a human one.Finally, it is important to note explanations beyond drift and selection in forming deserts. For instance, large inversions on either the human or Neanderthal and Denisovan lineages could theoretically prevent introgression in these regions by suppressing recombination. Considering the overlap of Neanderthal and Denisovan deserts [30], large inversions seem unlikely to explain all of the archaic depletions found to date but remain a formal possibility. Unfortunately, identifying potential lineage-specific inversions is incredibly difficult given the deterioration of ancient DNA samples and short sequencing read lengths. What are the functional and phenotypic consequences of hybridization?A critical question in studying archaic–modern human hybridization is the functional impact of the remaining introgressed archaic sequence in the modern human genome. How has introgressed sequence shaped human evolution? How is it currently affecting modern human phenotypes and health and disease? Is the effect of Neanderthal sequence on human phenotypes proportional to the low amount of Neanderthal ancestry present in the human genome, or are there instances where Neanderthal ancestry has a disproportionately large effect?Several studies examining certain modern human populations have identified introgressed Neanderthal haplotypes that have risen to higher frequency than expected by drift (Fig 2D). The functional significance of these genes has been hypothesized based on prior biological studies and association with normal and disease phenotypes [63,64]. For example, a Neanderthal version of the gene BNC2 was identified at high frequency in several non-African populations—a sign of putative adaptive introgression—and is associated with skin pigmentation levels in Europeans [63,65]. Additionally, putatively adaptive introgressed sequences have been identified at several genes that play key roles in immunological function, such as STAT2 [66], OAS1 [67], and TLR1/6/10 [65,68]. There are also examples of certain populations carrying putatively adaptive introgressed sequences from Denisovans, such as in Greenlandic Inuit the genes TBX15 and WARS2 [69]—associated with adipose tissue differentiation and distribution—and in Tibetans the high-altitude adaptation gene EPAS1 [70]. These and other instances of possible adaptive introgression [71] support the hypothesis that archaic hominins, who inhabited Eurasia for 400 ky before humans, would have been a source of advantageous genetic variants pre-adapted to local environmental features, such as colder climates, lower ultraviolet (UV) exposure, and endemic pathogens. Alternatively, archaic hominins may simply have provided a reservoir of additional genetic variation to modern humans, some of which happened to be advantageous following introgression into modern humans but which were not necessarily pre-adapted to the Eurasian environment. It should also be noted that selection against introgressed archaic alleles seems to have been the predominant pattern across the genome as indicated by the low levels of retained archaic ancestry, especially in functionally important regions. This raises questions of whether admixture was beneficial overall for ancient humans migrating out of Africa and to what extent the benefits of some alleles were able to outweigh the costs of others.While there is increasing power to detect these archaic introgressed segments in modern human populations, our understanding of the evolutionary and fitness consequences remains murky. In the case of introgressed Neanderthal sequence, researchers have leveraged large association studies to infer the effects of archaic sequences [63,64]. Applying a similar approach to introgressed Denisovan sequences has proven more difficult, since those populations with Denisovan ancestry are underrepresented in large association studies and genomic data sets. Furthermore, if our intent is to understand the features under selection at the time of introgression, it is important to remember that the phenotypic effects of archaic sequence we see manifested today appear in very different environments than the ones for which they would have been selected. This will confound attempts to draw connections between the phenotypic effects of introgressed archaic sequences today and the original selected phenotypes.In addition to leveraging association studies or prior biological findings to infer the effects of introgressed sequence, several recent studies have examined the direct effects of introgressed variants on gene regulation. At sites of putatively adaptive introgressed archaic sequences, researchers have observed Neanderthal alleles affecting expression levels of immunologically relevant genes OAS1/2/3 and TLR1/6/10 and observed that these expression differences can be cell-type specific and influenced by environmental stimuli [65]. Others have correlated the genotypes of putatively introgressed Neanderthal alleles with the expression of nearby genes and found introgressed archaic alleles contribute proportionally more to expression variation than nonarchaic alleles [72]. In individuals that are heterozygous for the Neanderthal and human alleles, researchers found frequent instances of allele-specific expression and a significant down-regulation of Neanderthal allele expression in specific brain subregions and the testes relative to other tissues [73]. These findings suggest the phenotypic effects of introgressed archaic sequences are more likely mediated through gene regulation than protein changes (Fig 2C). Recent developments in genomic editing technologies should allow future studies to more thoroughly explore these regulatory effects through in vitro experiments. Was there gene flow from modern humans into Neanderthals?Most studies to date have focused on the Neanderthal and Denisovan contribution to the modern human genome through hybridization. However, investigating the contribution of modern human admixture to these archaic hominin genomes is also of great interest. New research is uncovering instances of potential gene flow from early humans into Neanderthal populations. Analyses of nuclear DNA from multiple Neanderthal samples and modern humans [74] support models in which an early human population—diverged from the population ancestral to contemporary Africans and non-Africans—contributed low levels (0.1–2%) of sequence to a Neanderthal lineage ~100 kya (Fig 1). More complete data from these archaic DNA samples [75] improved these estimates, demonstrating the gene flow event occurred at least 130–145 kya into a lineage ancestral to both Vindija and Altai Neanderthal populations. Analyses of mitochondrial DNA from multiple Neanderthal and human samples suggest that an even earlier gene flow occurred from humans into Neanderthals, potentially as early as ~300 kya [76]. These studies highlight the importance of collecting and analyzing additional archaic samples as well as illustrating the complexity and likely pervasiveness of admixture between different hominin groups.Characterizing human gene flow into archaic hominins allows researchers to explore novel hypotheses, for example, the potential for sex bias in Neanderthal populations. As noted previously, the depletion of Neanderthal ancestry on the modern human X chromosome could be the product of more frequent Neanderthal male and human female pairings leaving descendants in the human population. If a reciprocal depletion of human ancestry was found on the Neanderthal X chromosome, it could indicate a greater frequency of human male and Neanderthal female pairings in the Neanderthal population. Such findings could be informative about early cultural dynamics, for instance, if admixed offspring were more likely to remain with the mother’s population than the father’s.",introductiontoday
